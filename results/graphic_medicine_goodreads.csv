E poi in fondo anche Michelangelo era bipolare. E Jeff Buckley, Van Gogh, Sylvia Plath... il meglio del meglio, insomma.

mental,Gentleman Jim,Raymond Briggs Seth,,"A graphic novel classic from one of the world's best-known cartoonists
Gentleman Jimis the story of Jim Bloggs, an imaginative toilet cleaner who, dissatisfied with his station in life, devotes his time to envisioning a world beyond it. His walls are lined with books like Out in the Silver West, The Boys' Book of Pirates, and Executive Opportunities, which provide fodder for his ruminations on career change. Encouraged by his wife, who is also eager to incorporate more adventure into her life, Jim sets out to bring these dreams to fruition by accumulating various accoutrements, only to discover that the life of an executive, an artist, or a cowboy is more complicated and costly than it appears.
Jim's childlike understanding of the world that surrounds him is enhanced by Raymond Briggs's subtle and inventive illustrations. Fantasies are portrayed as organic clouds that move between and overlap outlined panels of his reality, and myopic Jim is drawn smaller and softer than the policemen and bureaucrats interested in impeding his search for adventure. As he begins to infringe more seriously on the law, the city workers and their speech boxes become increasingly angular, much like the rigid rules and regulations restricting his sincere quest. With this playful style, Briggs expertly transforms common feelings of inadequacy into an endearing and enjoyable experience that speaks across generations, concluding with an optimistic implication that even a misfortunate outcome can be better than no change at all.
This classic novel, originally published in 1980, is presented by Drawn & Quarterly in a new edition.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3429696-gentleman-jim

The novel starts with a single question: ""How did I get here?"" The answer lies in the pages that follow, and it's far from simple. Pressured by media, friends, the workplace, personal relationships, and fashion trends, Anna descends into a seemingly unending cycle of misery. And whenever she tries to climb out of the abyss, her own personal demon, Tyranny, is there to push her back in. The contest seems uneven, and it might be except for one thing: Anna's strength of character has given rise to her deadly enemy. Ironically, it is that same strength of character that has the ultimate power to save her from the ravages of Tyranny.

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.

As a recent college grad, Belle Yang fled an abusive boyfriend who became a terrifying stalker.

Fleeing the ravages of war, four brothers had reunited in the family home, where (like Belle) they chafed against a traditional father, the patriarch.
In Forget Sorrow, Belle weaves a story within a story as she sets her personal journey of self-discovery against her ancestral history--an epic drama of folly and betrayal, integrity and endurance during times of hunger, war, and Communist oppression. Recounting the lives and choices of her grandfather, his brothers, and her King Lear-like great-grandfather, Belle at last finds healing--and the strength to honor both her father and herself. .",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30848719-forget-sorrow

When Belle Yang was forced to take refuge in her parents' home after an abusive boyfriend began stalking her, her father entertained her with stories of old China. The history she'd ignored while growing up became a source of comfort and inspiration, and narrowed the gap separating her--an independent, Chinese-American woman--from her Old World Chinese parents.
In Forget Sorrow, Yang makes her debut into the graphic form with the story of her father's family, reunited under the House of Yang in Manchuria during the Second World War and struggling--both together and individually--to weather poverty, famine, and, later, Communist oppression. The parallels between Belle Yang's journey of self-discovery and the lives and choices of her grandfather, his brothers, and their father (the Patriarch) speak powerfully of the conflicts between generations--and of possibilities for reconciliation.

mental,Daddy's Girl,Debbie Drechsler,,"Fantagraphics Books is proud to re-release one of the most powerful and moving books in its distinguished publishing history: Debbie Drechsler's first collection of short comic stories, Daddy's Girl. Originally published in 1995 and distributed only to comic book specialty stores, Daddy's Girlwas ahead of its time: Two years before The Kiss, Kathryn Harrison's critically acclaimed story of her incestuous relationship with her father, Dreschler's account of her abuse at the hands of her father, told from the point of view of an adolescent, is one of the most searingly honest, empathetic, and profoundly disturbing uses of the comics medium in its history.
Rendered entirely in black and white, Drechsler's meticulous brush lines gather into heavy textures that suggest the claustrophobic tension of the environment that threatens her pre-teen and adolescent female protagonists. Characters such as Lily, who can't escape her father's abuse, and Franny, a girl whose desire to be accepted leads her into dangerous territory, struggle not to be visually and emotionally overwhelmed. Both girls are rendered in chunky, rounded lines, as if they've been shaped by the oppressive weight of their blandly suburban milieu, where pretending that everything is all right and maintaining the status quo is prized above truth and upheaval. However, Drechsler's characters also have wide-open eyes, suggesting that they still maintain their innocence, and their world does contain some beauty and hope, as long as the characters have the resolve to look for it: art and creation is offered as a form of salvation. Central to this quasi-memoir is Lily's relationship to her father--a confused jumble of fear, trepidation, and love.
Drechsler's book was nominated for an Ignatz award the year it was released, and she went on to create the critically acclaimed The Summer of Love. With the critical and commercial success of mature and uncompromising works by women cartoonists such as Fun Home, Squirrel Mother, and Persepolis, Daddy's Girlshould receive serious media attention and find a responsive readership.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968975.Daddy_s_Girl

Part travelogue, part indictment of mad medicine, 'Depresso' is Tom Freeman's hilarious journey through the vagaries of the system to emerge scathed but content with being 'bonkers'.
The story unfolds over several years, in China and the UK, during which anti-depressants reduce Tom to a zombie and alternative therapies drive him to comic re-examinations of his life, his work and relationships.
Throughout the adventure he is shadowed by the White Lizard, a familiar, a conscience, a pain in the arse who helps and hinders Tom's recovery, and is justly the butt of some wicked humour.

We will start our journey in the eye as that is a common entrance place to the brain. I shall ruminate about the eye and its properties. I shall tell how the eye's seeing is sorted-out in the brain and the magical nature of it and I shall warn of all the things that can go wrong in this sorting-out process. After the eye, we shall travel to the ear and discuss the world that is heard and how it is heard in the brain and all the awful things that can go wrong; some of them amusing and some not amusing. Taste and smell will of course be covered as these are also things of interest to the brain. We will also touch upon touch, so to speak. We will also touch upon the scalp, but only lightly and briefly. Once we have looked at the brain's government of the senses we shall start to talk about the really interesting stuff.

New York Tomes bestselling novelist Chuck Palahniuk and acclaimed artist Cameron Stewart have collaborated for one of the most highly anticipated comic book and literary events of 2015--the return of Tyler Durden. The first rule of Fight Club 2 might be not to talk about it, but Fight Club 2 is generating international headlines and will introduce a new generation of readers to Project Mayhem.
Praise for the comics that comprise Fight Club 2:
""At turns deeply poignant and very funny, Palahniuk's freakish fables capture a twisted zeitgeist and add an oddly inspirational and subversive voice to the contemporary canon.... In the post-9/11 present, a hyperactive, Internet-obsessed, war- and recession-weary America apparently needs Tyler again.""--THE ATLANTIC
""The book is fantastic, my highest recommendation.... Excellent work by Cameron Stewart and David Mack, and by our awesome friends at Dark Horse Comics.""--Brian Michael Bendis
""If Tyler Durden needed a resurgence, there's no time like the present for his return... Fight Club 2 is a comic that taps back into everything great about the source material, and one that makes Tyler Durden's warm nihilistic embrace a welcome draw back into a familiar world of cynicism, violence, and anarchy....""Tyler Lives,"" and I couldn't be happier by the prospect of more bedlam.""--NEWSARAMA
""Palahniuk is delivering a worthy sequel to his most beloved story.""--THE NERDIST

mental,Stitches,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6407014-stitches

Allora ho deciso di fare semplicemente un elenco di quello che c'e dentro:

- Parole
- Storie di cose che mi sono successe
- Storie di cose che sono successe ad altri per colpa mia
- Otto milliardi di dollari*
- Storie di cani

The school is a hotbed of bullying and rape kept slightly in check by a feudal organization called the Salon. The Salon protects its members from random abuse by specifying who can/must rape whom (yeah, there are must rapes here) under what circumstances, and punishing those who rape/abuse without proper permission. All this to be decided at the whim of the Salon head.
Sex at the school is both an overwhelming obsession, as befits an all-male society where there are no other outlets for stress, and a matter of down-and-dirty power politics, not unlike an American jail.
When you throw in the Byzantine institution of the Salon, you have a scenario reminiscent of the surrealistic, closed, hothouse world of British boys' schools. But the Rika world is even more bizarre than that.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2209736._Shiiku_Gakari_Rika_1_

A few years prior, Sergeant Brennan lost one of his closest friends--a young combat veteran--to suicide and has vowed to do everything in his power to keep his Marines from a similar fate. On their last night in-country, Brennan, who has long kept a tattered copy of the Odysseywith him on deployment, shares his version of Homer's classic with his fellow soldiers to help prepare them for the transition back home.
Brennan plunges into a rich retelling of Odysseus's long journey home from the battlefield at Troy, during which Odysseus and his men confront numerous obstacles--from the lure of a psychedelic lotus plant to ghoulish shades in the Land of the Dead to the seductive songs of the deadly Sirens--as they try to make it back to Greece. Along the way, Brennan and his fellow Marines map the struggles faced by Odysseus and his men onto their own--isolation, addiction, guilt, depression, and loss. Through his retelling, Brennan reminds his squad that the gulf separating the battlefield from the home front is deep, wide, and sometimes hard to cross--that it is possible to travel all the way home and, like the characters in the Odyssey,still feel lost at sea.
Tragic, poignant, and at times funny and hopeful, The Odyssey of Sergeant Jack Brennanbrilliantly conveys the profound challenges that many of today's veterans face upon returning to civilian life, even as it tells ""the oldest war story of all time.""",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893538-the-odyssey-of-sergeant-jack-brennan

As seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl named Una, it takes place in northern England in 1977, as the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer of prostitutes, is on the loose and creating panic among the townspeople. As the police struggle in their clumsy attempts to find the killer, and the headlines in the local paper become more urgent, a once self-confident Una teaches herself to ""lower her gaze"" in order to deflect attention from boys.
After she is ""slut-shamed"" at school for having birth control pills, Una herself is the subject of violent acts for which she comes to blame herself. But as the police finally catch up and identify the killer, Una grapples with the patterns of behavior that led her to believe she was to blame.
Becoming Unbecoming combines various styles, press clippings, photo-based illustrations, and splashes of color to convey Una's sense of confusion and rage, as well as sobering statistics on sexual violence against women. The book is a no-holds-barred indictment of sexual violence against women and the shame and blame of its victims that also celebrates the empowerment of those able to gain control over their selves and their bodies.
Una (a pseudonym) is an artist, academic, and comics creator. Becoming Unbecoming, which took seven years to create, is her first book. She lives in the United Kingdom.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28818824-becoming-unbecoming

mental,Vincent,Barbara Stok Camila Werner,,"Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) e sua mente torturada conceberam uma arte fascinante que transcendeu sua propria historia para se tornar um dos mais expressivos e maravilhosos conjuntos de pinturas jamais concebidos. Nesta graphic novel de tracos pop originalissimos, Barbara Stok retrata de forma delicada e luminosa os ultimos anos da vida do pintor holandes, passados na Franca, onde encontrou nao apenas seu fim, mas tambem a natureza e a luz que imortalizou em seus quadros.
Em 1888, apos uma estadia de dois anos em Paris, Vincent van Gogh muda-se para Arles, no sul da Franca. A luminosidade, os espacos abertos e as paisagens bucolicas da regiao, alem do proprio contato com a natureza, fornecem ao artista a materia-prima para aquela que e considerada a fase mais rica e revolucionaria de sua arte.
Se por um lado o ambiente o enche de contentamento e esperanca, por outro agravam-se seu desequilibrio e sua angustia, piorados ainda pela falta de dinheiro e de perspectivas concretas de futuro e pela culpa de ser um fardo para o irmao, Theo, que o sustentava financeiramente.
E esse turbulento e rico periodo, nao apenas crucial para a compreensao do genio Van Gogh como tambem emblematico de sua existencia, que a artista grafica Barbara Stok retrata, com um colorido e uma singeleza dignos do genio holandes. Barbara pinta com todas as cores um Vincent humano, com suas ambiguidades e fraquezas. Incorporando sabiamente trechos de cartas escritas ao irmao Theo e telas do proprio pintor, aborda seu processo criativo, suas ideias sobre pintura e a obcecada conviccao em sua propria arte, que sempre o guiou. O resultado e um personagem cativante, repleto de nuances, e que emociona por sua arte e tambem pela pureza da paixao com que a perseguia.
Barbara Stok nasceu em 1970 em Groningen, na Holanda. Trabalhou como fotografa e jornalista ate estrear, em 1998, com o livro de tiras Barbaraal tot op het bot, no qual retratava o proprio cotidiano. Seu traco original, sua narrativa delicada e sua maneira de ampliar pequenos detalhes da existencia fizeram sucesso.

mental,Stitches: A Memoir,David Small,cancer,"Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award and finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards: the prize-winning children's author depicts a childhood from hell in this searing yet redemptive graphic memoir.
One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statement.
A silent movie masquerading as a book, Stitches renders a broken world suddenly seamless and beautiful again. Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award (Young Adult); finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards (Best Writer/Artist: Nonfiction; Best Reality-Based Work).",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13509102-stitches

Imagine descobrir que um amigo seu de escola acabou se transformando num dos mais temidos serial killers do seculo? Essa e a historia real que o quadrinista Derf Backderf relata na graphic novel Meu Amigo Dahmer. Meu Amigo Dahmer traz o perfil do psicopata Jeff Dahmer quando este ainda era um aluno do ensino medio. O autor do livro foi seu colega de turma nos anos 1970, e conviveu com o futuro ""canibal de Milwaukee"" com uma intimidade que Dahmer talvez so viesse a compartilhar novamente com suas vitimas. Juntos, Derf e Dahmer estudaram para provas, mataram aula, jogaram basquete. Os dois tomaram rumos diferentes, e Derf so voltaria a saber do amigo pelo noticiario, anos depois. Em 1991, os crimes de Jeffrey Dahmer vieram a tona: necrofilia, canibalismo e uma lista de pelo menos 17 mortos, entre homens adultos e garotos. O primeiro assassinato teria acontecido meses apos a formatura no colegio. Alem de remexer nos seus velhos cadernos e albuns de fotografia, Derf consultou seus amigos de adolescencia, antigos professores, os arquivos do fbi e a cobertura da midia apos a descoberta de seus crimes antes de roteirizar Meu Amigo Dahmer. Muitos tinham historias do garoto que costumava fingir surtos epilepticos, que exagerava na bebida antes mesmo de ir para a aula e que parecia ter uma fixacao em dissecar os animais atropelados que encontrava perto de casa. Mas quem realmente poderia prever os caminhos sombrios pelos quais ele seguiria? Seria possivel evitar tamanha tragedia?

According to Schaffer, who acknowledges a heavy influence from Lynch (and also Japanese auteur, Shinya Tsukamoto), the book is an experiment in subjective storytelling, and came about as the result of an unconventional, intuitive creative process developed by himself and KatieJane Garside (vocalist with extreme rock band Queenadreena).

If you're going to do something like that without pretension or agenda, you have to first expose the same thing from within yourself, and so this book is a glimpse of that truth, from the perspective of both Katie and myself, with a little bit of space for the reader. It's a book designed to reach out through example, and it will come alive if you bring something of yourself to it.""",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25783426-indigo-vertigo

mental,Cruddy,Lynda Barry,,"On a September night in 1971, a few days after getting busted for dropping two of the 127 hits of acid found in a friend's shoe, a sixteen-year-old who is grounded for a year curls up in the corner of her ratty bedroom, picks up a pen, and begins to write. ""Once upon a cruddy time on a cruddy street on the side of a cruddy hill in the cruddiest part of a crudded-out town in a cruddy state, country, world, solar system, universe. The cruddy girl named Roberta was writing the cruddy book of her cruddy life and the name of the book was called Cruddy.
Now the truth can finally be revealed about the mysterious day long ago when the authorities found a child, calmly walking in the boiling desert, covered with blood. She could not give the authorities any information about why she was the only survivor and everyone else was lying around in hacked-up pieces.""
Roberta Rohbeson, 1971. Her overblown, drug-induced teenage rant against a world bounded by ""the cruddy top bedroom of a cruddy rental house on a very cruddy mud road behind cruddy Black Cat Lumber"" soon becomes a detailed account of another story. It is a story about which Roberta has kept silent for five years, until, under the influence of a pale hippie called the Turtle and a drug called Creeper, her tale giddily unspools...
Roberta Rohbeson, 1967. The world of Roberta, age eleven, is terrifyingly unbounded, a one-way cross-country road trip fueled by revenge and by greed, a violent, hallucinatory, sometimes funny, more often horrific year of killings, betrayals, arson, and a sinister set of butcher knives, each with its own name.
Welcome to ""Cruddy,"" Lynda Barry's masterful tale of the two intertwinednarratives set five years -- an eternity -- apart, which form the backbone of Roberta's life. ""Cruddy"" is a wild ride indeed, a fairy tale-""cum""-low-budget horror movie populated by a cast of characters that will remain vivid in the reader's mind long after the final page: Roberta's father, a dangerous alcoholic and out-of-work meat cutter in search of his swindled inheritance; the frightening owners of the Knocking Hammer Bar and sometime slaughterhouse; and two charming but quite mad escapees from the Barbara V. Herrmann Home for Adolescent Rest. Written with a teenager's eye for freakish detail and a nervous ability to make the most horrible scenes seem hilarious, Roberta's two stories -- part ""Easy Rider"" and part bipolar ""Wizard of Oz"" -- painfully but inevitably converge in a surprising denouement in a nightmarish Dreamland in the Nevada desert.
By turns terrifying, darkly funny, and resonant with humanity, propelled by all the narrative power of a superior thriller and burnished by the author's pitch-perfect ear for dialogue, ""Cruddy"" is a stunning achievement.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1182947.Cruddy

From the optimizing individual to game theory to price theory, The Cartoon Introduction to Economicsis the most digestible, explicable, and humorous 200-page introduction to microeconomics you'll ever read.
Bauman has put the ""comedy"" into ""economy"" at comedy clubs and universities around the country and around the world (his ""Principles of Economics, Translated"" is a YouTube cult classic). As an educator at both the university and high school levels, he has learned how to make economics relevant to today's world and today's students. As Google's chief economist, Hal Varian, wrote, ""You don't need a brand-new economics. You just need to see the really cool stuff, the material they didn't get to when you studied economics."" The Cartoon Introduction to Economics is all about integrating the really cool stuff into an overview of the entire discipline of microeconomics, from decision trees to game trees to taxes and thinking at the margin.
Rendering the cool stuff fun is the artistry of the illustrator and lauded graphic novelist Klein. Panel by panel, page by page, he puts comics into economics. So if the vertiginous economy or a dour professor's 600-page econ textbook has you desperate for a fun, factual guide to economics, reach for The Cartoon Introduction to Economicsand let the collaborative genius of the Klein-Bauman team walk you through an entire introductory microeconomics course.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18885331-the-cartoon-introduction-to-economics

A groundbreaking picture book on depression with stunning illustrations. 
With stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori examines how depression affects one's whole outlook upon life, and shows that there can be an escape - it may not be easy to find, but it is there. Drawn from Debi's own experiences and with a moving testimony at the end of the book explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope, Debi hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.

This is partly because of their legendary ability to turn a once fertile realm into a blackened, smoking ruin and partly because popular mythology shows them as monstrous opponents with a tendency to pick fights with smaller creatures.

David B. was born Pierre-Francois Beauchard in a small town near Orleans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.
Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Francois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Francois's grandparents and we relive his grandfathers' experiences in both World Wars.

The Hospital Suiteis a landmark work by the celebrated cartoonist and small-press legend John Porcellino--an autobiographical collection detailing his struggles with illness in the 1990s and early 2000s.
In 1997, John began to have severe stomach pain. He soon found out he needed emergency surgery to remove a benign tumor from his small intestine. In the wake of the surgery, he had numerous health complications that led to a flare-up of his preexisting tendencies toward anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The Hospital Suiteis Porcellino's response to these experiences--simply told stories drawn in the honest, heart-wrenching style of his much-loved King-Cat mini-comics. His gift for spare yet eloquent candor makes The Hospital Suitean intimate portrayal of one person's experiences that is also intensely relatable.
Porcellino's work is lauded for its universality and quiet, clear-eyed contemplation of everyday life. The Hospital Suiteis a testimony to this subtle strength, making his struggles with the medical system and its consequences for his mental health accessible and engaging.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613690-the-hospital-suite

Nao's life continues to seesaw. Her boyfriend dumps her; a toy deal falls through. But she also meets Gregory, an interesting washing-machine repairman, and Ray, an art teacher at the Buddhist Center. She begins to draw and meditate to ease her mind and open her heart--and in doing so comes to a big realization: Life isn't black-and-white after all . . . it's much more like brown.

Through stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori provides a fascinating and absorbing portrait of depression and hope in Night Shift, a moving picture book about a young girl haunted by dragons. The young girl battles the dragons using 'night skills': skills that give her both the ability to survive inside her own darkness and the knowledge that nothing--not even long, dark nights filled with monsters--will last forever.
Drawn from Gliori's own experiences and struggles with depression, the book concludes with a moving author's note explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope. Gliori hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.

From the optimizing individual to game theory to price theory, The Cartoon Introduction to Economicsis the most digestible, explicable, and humorous 200-page introduction to microeconomics you'll ever read.
Bauman has put the ""comedy"" into ""economy"" at comedy clubs and universities around the country and around the world (his ""Principles of Economics, Translated"" is a YouTube cult classic). As an educator at both the university and high school levels, he has learned how to make economics relevant to today's world and today's students. As Google's chief economist, Hal Varian, wrote, ""You don't need a brand-new economics. You just need to see the really cool stuff, the material they didn't get to when you studied economics."" The Cartoon Introduction to Economicsis all about integrating the really cool stuff into an overview of the entire discipline of microeconomics, from decision trees to game trees to taxes and thinking at the margin.
Rendering the cool stuff fun is the artistry of the illustrator and lauded graphic novelist Klein. Panel by panel, page by page, he puts comics into economics. So if the vertiginous economy or a dour professor's 600-page econ textbook has you desperate for a fun, factual guide to economics, reach for The Cartoon Introduction to Economicsand let the collaborative genius of the Klein-Bauman team walk you through an entire introductory microeconomics course.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7333109-the-cartoon-introduction-to-economics

mental,The Abominable Mr. Seabrook,Joe Ollmann,,"In the early twentieth century, travel writing represented the desire for the expanding bourgeoisie to experience the exotic cultures of the world past their immediate surroundings. Journalist William Buehler Seabrook was emblematic of this trend--participating in voodoo ceremonies, riding camels cross the Sahara desert, communing with cannibals and most notably, popularizing the term ""zombie"" in the West. A string of his bestselling books show an engaged, sympathetic gentleman hoping to share these strange, hidden delights with the rest of the world. He was willing to go deeper than any outsider had before. But, of course, there was a dark side. Seabrook was a barely functioning alcoholic who was deeply obsessed with bondage and the so-called mystical properties of pain and degradation. His life was a series of traveling highs and drunken lows; climbing on and falling off the wagon again and again. What led the popular and vivid writer to such a sad state?
Cartoonist Joe Ollmann spent seven years researching Seabrook's life, interviewing surviving family and accessing long neglected archives, in order to piece together the peripatetic life of a forgotten American writer. Often weaving in Seabrook's own words and those of his biographers, Ollmann's The Abominable Mr. Seabrook posits Seabrook the believer versus Seabrook the exploiter, and leaves the reader to consider where one ends and the other begins.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29875927-the-abominable-mr-seabrook

At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.
A work of great bravery and humanity, Stitchesis a gripping and ultimately redemptive story of a man's struggle to understand the past and reclaim his voice.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7440306-stitches
mental,Stitches,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9440024-stitches

-You are making it happen. All the deaths. All the destruction.-
Tom is a solid, but not great, musician. While his bandmates are happy to play gigs for themselves at their own clubs, drinking free beer and shooting the breeze, Tom aches for the next level, whatever that is. And as musicians are wont to do in magical fables, he meets a mysterious stranger with a seemingly simple offer: take a battered old trumpet for free, and just enjoy it, no exchanges and no strings. Whenever Tom plays it, the extraordinary music blows away his growing throngs of fans, and deadly mishaps start to follow. Tom may not have sold his soul for the music of the heavens, but he seems to have bargained away something much more serious.

In 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer -- the most notorious serial killer since Jack the Ripper -- seared himself into the American consciousness. To the public, Dahmer was a monster who committed unthinkable atrocities. To Derf Backderf, ""Jeff"" was a much more complex figure: a high school friend with whom he had shared classrooms, hallways, and car rides.
In My Friend Dahmer, a haunting and original graphic novel, writer-artist Backderf creates a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of a disturbed young man struggling against the morbid urges emanating from the deep recesses of his psyche -- a shy kid, a teenage alcoholic, and a goofball who never quite fit in with his classmates. With profound insight, what emerges is a Jeffrey Dahmer that few ever really knew, and one readers will never forget.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959045-my-friend-dahmer

En Mi amigo Dahmer, el autor Derf Backderf repasa la adolescencia de uno de sus companeros de clase, que resulto ser uno de los peores asesinos en serie de la historia de los Estados Unidos
Premio Revelacion 2014 en el Festival Internacional del Comic de Angouleme
Jeffrey Dahmer, apodado el El carnicero de Milwaukee, fue uno de los asesinos en serie mas celebres de la historia de los Estados Unidos. El autor de esta novela grafica, Derf Backderf, compartio con Dahmer sus anos de instituto y refleja en esta obra precisa y documentada su progresivo descenso a los infiernos. Para Backderf, ""Jeff"" era una figura mucho mas compleja de lo que reflejan los medios, alguien con quien compartio clases, pasillos y paseos en coche.
Mi amigo Dahmer es la historia de la juventud de su protagonista, y de su incapacidad para empatizar con los demas, vista a traves de los ojos de uno de sus companeros de clase. Derf Backderf (periodista de formacion) describe la personalidad desfasada de Dahmer, fascinada por los animales muertos y mortificada por su atraccion por los hombres. Una obra fascinante y perturbadora a la vez.
El propio Dahmer llego a asegurar, antes de morir en la carcel, que ""este es el gran final de una vida malgastada, y el resultado final es abrumadoramente deprimente... La historia de una vida patetica, enferma y miserable, nada mas"".",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20812804-mi-amigo-dahmer

mental,Stitches: A Memoir,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statement.

mental,Everywhere Antennas,Julie Delporte Helge Dascher,,"A poetic novel that plumbs the depths of self-doubt and technological fatigue
Julie Delporte's Everywhere Antennas is a deeply affecting, sparely constructed novel, equal parts Waldenand The Bell Jar. Told in the first person, it offers diary-like entries from an anonymous narrator who is undergoing a nervous breakdown and struggling to hold together a failing relationship. In soft, flowing colored pencil, Delporte shows her narrator coming to terms with a rare and misunderstood sensitivity to the radiation emitted by the televisions, cell phones, and computers that permeate urban life.
On each page a few words are paired with an image or two, conveying a moment or a thought simply but effectively. Over the course of the book, the anonymous narrator moves from place to place, looking for solutions to her melancholy in the countryside via isolation and in the city with friends, sometimes turning to medication for answers. Throughout, her emotional and intellectual landscape receives as much attention as her physical surroundings.
Everywhere Antennasis the portrait of a woman caught in the margins, struggling to balance the demands of technology and modern life with the need to find meaningful relationships and work. Roughly hewn figures, sketched in pencil crayon on brightly contrasting backgrounds, populate the pages of this flowing, emotive work. With Everywhere Antennas, Delporte proves herself a master craftswoman of heartbreakingly personal, beautifully literary graphic fiction.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18465544-everywhere-antennas

mental,Swallow Me Whole,Nate Powell,illness disorder,"Swallow Me Whole is a love story carried by rolling fog, terminal illness, hallucination, apophenia, insect armies, secrets held, unshakeable faith, and the search for a master pattern to make sense of one's unraveling.
In his most ambitious book to date, Nate Powell quietly explores the dark corners of adolescence -- not the cliched melodramatic outbursts of rebellion, but the countless tiny moments of madness, the vague relief of medication, and mixed blessing of family ties. As the story unfolds, two stepsiblings hold together amidst schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, family breakdown, animal telepathy, misguided love, and the tiniest hope that everything will someday make sense.
Deliberately paced, delicately drawn, and drenched in shadows, Swallow Me Whole is a landmark achievement for Nate Powell and a suburban ghost story that will haunt readers long after its final pages.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22380715-swallow-me-whole

It was the greatly admired Winston Churchill, a depression sufferer for much of his life, who nicknamed this human condition ""Black Dog.""
Living with a Black Dogis perhaps the most useful book ever created about depression. In simple text and strongly supportive illustrations, this slim volume examines, explains, and demystifies one of the most widespread and debilitating problems afflicting modern society.
Whether you've struggled with your own Black Dog for years, wondered why you're feeling sort of ""ruff"" lately, or known someone shadowed by a dark canine, Living with a Black Dogis for you. Artist and writer Matthew Johnstone, a depression sufferer himself, delivers a moving and uplifting insight into life with this unsavory companion. Even better, the book shows the strength and support to be found within and around us to tame this shaggy beast and ultimately bring it to heel.
Johnstone's book doesn't pretend to have all the answers. It doesn't resort to simple ""dog tricks"" for dealing with depression. But Living with a Black Dogdoes deliver understanding, hope, and the assurance that Black Dog days are not forever.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96202.Living_with_a_Black_Dog

First Year Healthypurports to be the story of a young woman, recently released from the hospital after an outburst, and her burgeoning relationship with an odd, perhaps criminal Turkish immigrant. In a scant forty-five pages, working with a vibrant, otherworldly palette of magentas, yellows, and grays, Michael DeForge brings to life a world whose shifting realities are as treacherous as the thin ice its narrator walks on. First Year Healthyis all it appears to be and more: a parable about mental illness, a folktale about magical cats, and a bizarre, compelling story about relationships.
DeForge's singular voice and vision have, in a few short years, rocketed his work to the apex of the contemporary comics canon. Ant Colony was his first book with Drawn & Quarterly: It appeared on The New York TimesGraphic Bestseller List and was lauded by the Chicago Tribune,The Globe and Mail, and Harper's Magazine.

Ogni tentativo di mitigare i disturbi ossessivi che governano la loro vita li immerge ancora piu profondamente nel tormento della schizofrenia, fino a una conclusione surreale ma inevitabile: Ruth sfidera l'ignoranza e il settarismo della comunita in cui vive, e paghera per la propria diversita.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21399867-portami-via

As Phoebe and her husband, Jeff, navigate the emotionally and physically fraught world of fertility experts, she takes stock of what matters in the rest of her life and reflects on the winding journey to her true calling as an artist. From her days as an amateur union organizer in Texas to her spiral into paralyzing depression in Mexico; from her soul-shrinking, all-for-the-benefits stint as an administrative assistant at a fancy university in Cambridge to her flirtation with rabbinical school, Phoebe illuminates the bumpy road to vocational and personal contentment.

mental,Race to Incarcerate: A Graphic Retelling,Sabrina Jones Marc Mauer Michelle Alexander,,"""Do not underestimate the power of the book you are holding in your hands.""
--Michelle Alexander
More than 2 million people are now imprisoned in the United States, producing the highest rate of incarceration in the world. How did this happen? As the director of The Sentencing Project, Marc Mauer has long been one of the country's foremost experts on sentencing policy, race, and the criminal justice system. His book Race to Incarceratehas become the essential text for understanding the exponential growth of the U.S. prison system; Michelle Alexander, author of the bestselling The New Jim Crow, calls it ""utterly indispensable."" Now, Sabrina Jones, a member of the World War 3 Illustratedcollective and an acclaimed author of politically engaged comics, has collaborated with Mauer to adapt and update the original book into a vivid and compelling comics narrative. Jones's dramatic artwork adds passion and compassion to the complex story of the penal system's shift from rehabilitation to punishment and the ensuing four decades of prison expansion, its interplay with the devastating ""War on Drugs,"" and its corrosive effect on generations of Americans.
With a preface by Mauer and a foreword by Alexander, Race to Incarcerate: A Graphic Retellingpresents a compelling argument about mass incarceration's tragic impact on communities of color--if current trends continue, one of every three black males and one of every six Latino males born today can expect to do time in prison. The race to incarcerate is not only a failed social policy, but also one that prevents a just, diverse society from flourishing.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13236016-race-to-incarcerate

Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.
David B. was born Pierre-Francois Beauchard in a small town near Orleans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.
Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Francois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Francois's grandparents and we relive his grandfathers' experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-Francois through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe""s losing battle with epilepsy.

Praise for the comics that comprise Fight Club 2:
""At turns deeply poignant and very funny, Palahniuk's freakish fables capture a twisted zeitgeist and add an oddly inspirational and subversive voice to the contemporary canon.... In the post-9/11 present, a hyperactive, Internet-obsessed, war- and recession-weary America apparently needs Tyler again.""--THE ATLANTIC
""The book is fantastic, my highest recommendation.... Excellent work by Cameron Stewart and David Mack, and by our awesome friends at Dark Horse Comics.""--Brian Michael Bendis
""If Tyler Durden needed a resurgence, there's no time like the present for his return... Fight Club 2 is a comic that taps back into everything great about the source material, and one that makes Tyler Durden's warm nihilistic embrace a welcome draw back into a familiar world of cynicism, violence, and anarchy....""Tyler Lives,"" and I couldn't be happier by the prospect of more bedlam.""--NEWSARAMA

It secured the cartoonist's place as one of his generation's most skillful and ambitious practitioners, and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family.
Mother, Come Homequietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Thomas, protected by a lion's mask that his mother gave him, constructs an identity for himself as ""the groundskeeper"": ritual and routine, already important to children that age, become paramount to him. He struggles desperately to keep up appearances while his father, a professor of symbolic logic, becomes lost in abstractions. Father and son begin to retreat into their fantasies, but only one emerges.
Mother, Come Homeis masterfully drawn: Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier's controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David's inexorable descent into utter despair. Hornschemeier is equally precise when it comes to Mother, Come Home's color palette: subdued but warm, which suits the story's melancholy and contemplative mode.

When Belle Yang was forced to take refuge in her parents' home after an abusive boyfriend began stalking her, her father entertained her with stories of old China. The history she'd ignored while growing up became a source of comfort and inspiration, and narrowed the gap separating her--an independent, Chinese-American woman--from her Old World Chinese parents.
In Forget Sorrow, Yang makes her debut into the graphic form with the story of her father's family, reunited under the House of Yang in Manchuria during the Second World War and struggling--both together and individually--to weather poverty, famine, and, later, Communist oppression. The parallels between Belle Yang's journey of self-discovery and the lives and choices of her grandfather, his brothers, and their father (the Patriarch) speak powerfully of the conflicts between generations--and of possibilities for reconciliation.

In each chapter, Cunningham explores a different mental health problem, using evocative imagery to describe the experience of mental illness, both from the point of view of those beset by illness and their friends and relatives. As Cunningham reveals this human experience, he also shows how society's perceptions of and reactions to mental illness perpetuate needless stigma, for example, the myth that schizophrenic people are more likely to commit crimes than non-schizophrenic people. Psychiatric Talesis a groundbreaking graphic work; it deftly demythologizes and destigmatizes the disorders that 26.2 percent of American adults live with every day.
Concluding with a reflection on how mental illness has affected his own life, Darryl Cunningham's Psychiatric Talesis a moving, engaging examination of what is, at its root, the human condition.

mental,Psychiatric Tales: Eleven Graphic Stories About Mental Illness,Darryl Cunningham,illness mental health,"Psychiatric Talesdraws on Darryl Cunningham's time working in a psychiatric ward to give a reasoned and sympathetic look into the world of mental illness. In each chapter, Cunningham explores a different mental health problem, using evocative imagery to describe the experience of mental illness, both from the point of view of those beset by illness and their friends and relatives. As Cunningham reveals this human experience, he also shows how society's perceptions of and reactions to mental illness perpetuate needless stigma, for example, the myth that schizophrenic people are more likely to commit crimes than non-schizophrenic people. Psychiatric Talesis a groundbreaking graphic work; it deftly demythologizes and destigmatizes the disorders that 26.2 percent of American adults live with every day.
Concluding with a reflection on how mental illness has affected his own life, Darryl Cunningham's Psychiatric Talesis a moving, engaging examination of what is, at its root, the human condition.
Darryl Cunningham is the creator of the Web comics Super-Samand John-of-the-Nightand The Streets of San Diablo. He is a prolific cartoonist, sculptor, and photographer, and lives in Leeds, England. This is his first book.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9824902-psychiatric-tales

Wry, comic, graphic, from the humdrum to the tragic, his patients' stories are the spokes that make Iwan's wheels go round in this humane and eloquently drawn account of a doctor's life.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22578304-the-bad-doctor

mental,Bitter Medicine: A Graphic Memoir of Mental Illness,Clem Martini Olivier Martini,illness mental health,"In 1976, Ben Martini was diagnosed with schizophrenia. A decade later, his brother Olivier was told he had the same disease. For the past thirty years the Martini family has struggled to comprehend and cope with a devastating illness, frustrated by a health care system lacking in resources and empathy, the imperfect science of medication, and the strain of mental illness on familial relationships.
Throughout it all, Olivier, an accomplished visual artist, drew. His sketches, comic strips, and portraits document his experience with, and capture the essence of, this all too frequently misunderstood disease. In ""Bitter Medicine,"" Olivier's poignant graphic narrative runs alongside and communicates with a written account of the past three decades by his younger brother, award-winning author and playwright Clem Martini. The result is a layered family memoir that faces head-on the stigma attached to mental illness.
Shot through with wry humour and unapologetic in its politics, ""Bitter Medicine"" is the story of the Martini family, a polemical and poetic portrait of illness, and a vital and timely call for action.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7793990-bitter-medicine

Shortly before her thirtieth birthday, Forney was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Flagrantly manic and terrified that medications would cause her to lose creativity, she began a years-long struggle to find mental stability while retaining her passions and creativity.
Searching to make sense of the popular concept of the crazy artist, she finds inspiration from the lives and work of other artists and writers who suffered from mood disorders, including Vincent van Gogh, Georgia O'Keeffe, William Styron, and Sylvia Plath. She also researches the clinical aspects of bipolar disorder, including the strengths and limitations of various treatments and medications, and what studies tell us about the conundrum of attempting to ""cure"" an otherwise brilliant mind.
Darkly funny and intensely personal, Forney's memoir provides a visceral glimpse into the effects of a mood disorder on an artist's work, as she shares her own story through bold black-and-white images and evocative prose.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542990-marbles

mental,Apollo's Song,Osamu Tezuka Camellia Nieh,,"Better to have loved and lost...
The gods with their poetic justice, can be unrelenting. Just ask the young cynic Shogo, who sinned against love. Electroshock therapy was only meant to bring him face to face with his own violent misdeeds, but instead landed him in the court of a stern goddess.
If the encounter was a hallucination, then it's a hallucination that starts to encroach on reality in this unforgettable tale penned by manga-god Osamu Tezuka and inspired by Greek myths of divine unforgiving. Sharing with his longer work Phoenixthe themes of recurrence and retribution as well as the spirit of high invention, Apollo's Songexplores the meaning of love and the consequences of its absence.
Shogo's mother is a bar hostess, his father could be any one of a dozen of her regular patrons. Growing up, he learns nothing of genuine love and tenderness, and when he witnesses his mother in the nearest approximation of which she's capable--lustful embrace--he receives a merciless beating soon afterwards. Shogo comes to hate the very notion of love. But goddesses, who are neither the Buddha nor Christ, do not excuse misfortunes of upbringing.
Apollo's Songreaches Olympian heights of tragedy as the story proceeds from a boxcar bound for a Nazi concentration camp to a dystopian future where human beings are persecuted by an ascendant race of their own clones. Will Shogo ever attain redemption, or, like the human race itself, will he have to relearn the lessons of love forever? Is it better to have loved and lost if the heartbreak must recur eternally?
Love, propagation, nature, war, death--Tezuka holds his trademark cornucopia of concerns together with striking characterizations, an unfailing sense of pacing, and of course, stunning imagery.
Though marked by a salty pessimism, this unique masterpiece from Tezuka's transitional period is also unabashedly romantic--and, at times, profoundly erotic. Combining a classic tale of thwarted love with cognitive ambiguities reminiscent of the work of Philip K. Dick, Apollo's Songis guaranteed to plumb new depths of the human heart with each rereading.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/534308.Apollo_s_Song

Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22015649-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

Everything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.
Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched. The zany art and probing text do an extraordinary job of simplifying Freud without trivializing him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1867315.Freud_For_Beginners

In a return to the literary and thematic territory of Lemire's breakthrough graphic novel ESSEX COUNTY, ROYAL CITY follows Patrick Pike, a fading literary star who reluctantly returns to the once-thriving factory town where he grew up. Patrick is quickly drawn back into the dramas of his two adult siblings, his overbearing Mother and his brow beaten Father, all of whom are still haunted by different versions of his youngest brother, Tommy, who drowned decades ago.
As each member of the family struggles to keep themselves above water, it quickly becomes clear that Tommy's death isn't the only dark secret tearing the town, and this family, apart at the seams. Can each member of the Pike family come to terms with their own guilt over Tommy's death, and make peace with the many versions of Tommy that still haunt them, or will they all be dragged down below the river along with his lingering ghost?
ROYAL CITY promises to be a sprawling, serialized graphic novel that will chart the lives, loves and losses of a troubled family and a vanishing town, across three decades.
Jeff Lemire is the creator of DESCENDER (with DUSTIN NGUYEN), AD: AFTER DEATH (with SCOTT SNYDER), ROUGHNECK, SECRET PATH (with Gord Downie), PLUTONA (with EMI LENNOX), ESSEX COUNTY, SWEET TOOTH, TRILLIUM, and THE UNDERWATER WELDER.

Davis Jim Kettner,health disorder,"At once punk rock and poignant, Ink in Wateris the visceral and groundbreaking graphic memoir of a young woman's devastating struggle with negative body image and eating disorders, and how she rose above her own destructive behaviors and feelings of inadequacy to live a life of strength and empowerment.
As a young artist living in Portland, Lacy Davis' eating disorder began with the germ of an idea: a seed of a thought that told her she just wasn't good enough. And like ink in water, that idea spread until it reached every corner of her being. This is the true story of Lacy's journey into the self-destructive world of multiple eating disorders. It starts with a young and positive Lacy, trying to grapple with our culture's body-image obsession and stay true to her riot grrrl roots. And while she initially succeeds in overcoming a nagging rumination about her body, a break up with a recovering addict starts her on a collision course with anorexia, health food obsession, and compulsive exercise addiction. At the request of her last real friend, she starts going to a twelve-step Overeaters Anonymous course, only to find that it conflicts with her punk feminist ideology.
Blending bold humor, a healthy dose of self-deprecation, vulnerability, literary storytelling, and dynamic and provocative artwork by illustrator Jim Kettner, Ink in Wateris an unflinching, brutally honest look into the author's mind: how she learned to take control of her damaging thoughts, redirect her perfectionism from self-destructive behaviors into writing and art, and how she committed herself to a life of health, strength, and nourishment.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33776084-ink-in-water

It prolongs the encounter, compelling the reader not only to notice, but to remember. This book is about making graphics memorable by using witty thinking. It argues that ideas which happen in the mind, stay in the mind. Beryl McAlhone and David Stuart begin by explaining what wit is and how it works. They make the case for wit in graphic design, seeing humour as the shortest distance between two people. The different routes designers can take are explainedincluding ambiguity, missing links, substitution and double-takes - to clarify the options available at the start of an assignment. A Smile in the Mind documents the power of intellectual playfulness as it invades even the corporate heartland of annual reports and the dry territory of technical literature. Designers can refer to examples for every category of graphics, from direct mail to information graphics, and for a variety of sectors from leisure and the arts to manufacturing and the law. For the finale, witty designers answer the big question: how did they get the idea? They offer a peep into their private working methods, as they check out word lists, look at things sideways, or put several jobs on the table at once. Gathering together the best examples of graphic wit over the past three decades, A Smile in the Mind shows work from over 300 designers in the USA, Britain, Europe and Japan.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/416534.A_Smile_in_the_Mind

Misled by land merchants, the Moodies discovered that settlement in Upper Canada was far from pastoral, but rather a wild frontier. Utterly unprepared for pioneer life, they soon found themselves starving in a hostile wilderness. With her husband absent in the army during the 1837 Rebellion, Susanna began publishing her writing to feed and clothe her growing family. The result was the novel Roughing It in the Bush--Moodie's aggravated and acerbic testament of pioneer life was praised in England but turned her into a controversial figure.

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.

Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28260562-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

In a series of 100 illustrations with accompanying text, Orli Auslander has captured a mood and emotional ambivalence that will be all too familiar for readers: trying to be the best wife, mother, and friend she can be, while simultaneously feeling shitty about virtually everything she does. Confronting her daily experience with dark humor and brilliant and brutal honesty, she shows us how being an overindulgent mother makes her feel as terrible as the times when she can't stand the sight of her kids; how saying yes to the wrong experiences and no to the right requests is equally bad; how her Jewish heritage complicates her relationships with her overly religious family and irreligious children; and how having a vagina is the ultimate inescapable struggle. With a distinctive, textured ink drawing style which brings to mind a female Robert Crumb and a neurotic Edward Gorey, I Feel Bad is a book that readers will buy for themselves and for a best friend, and where every reader will find the precise moment that Auslander voiced their own deepest anxiety in her poignant and hilarious illustrations.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31247646-i-feel-bad

Introducing Chaos explains how chaos makes its presence felt in many varieties of event, from the fluctuation of animal populations to the ups and downs of the stock market. It also examines the roots of chaos in modern mathematics and physics, and explores the relationship between chaos and complexity, the new unifying theory which suggests that all complex systems evolve from a few simple rules.

Czerwiec,,"In 1994, at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, MK Czerwiec took her first nursing job, at Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago, as part of the caregiving staff of HIV/AIDS Care Unit 371. Taking Turns pulls back the curtain on life in the ward.
A shining example of excellence in the treatment and care of patients, Unit 371 was a community for thousands of patients and families affected by HIV and AIDS and the people who cared for them. This graphic novel combines Czerwiec's memories with the oral histories of patients, family members, and staff. It depicts life and death in the ward, the ways the unit affected and informed those who passed through it, and how many look back on their time there today.
Czerwiec joined Unit 371 at a pivotal time in the history of AIDS: deaths from the syndrome in the Midwest peaked in 1995 and then dropped drastically in the following years, with the release of antiretroviral protease inhibitors. This positive turn of events led to a decline in patient populations and, ultimately, to the closure of Unit 371. Czerwiec's restrained, inviting drawing style and carefully considered narrative examine individual, institutional, and community responses to the AIDS epidemic--as well as the role that art can play in the grieving process.
Deeply personal yet made up of many voices, this history of daily life in a unique AIDS care unit is an open, honest look at suffering, grief, and hope among a community of medical professionals and patients at the heart of the epidemic.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32509945-taking-turns

health,Our Lady of Birth Control: A Cartoonist's Encounter with Margaret Sanger,Sabrina Jones,,"Working class nurse. Mother of three. Labor organizer. Margaret Sanger--best known as the pioneer of birth control--was revolutionary in more ways than one. In Sabrina Jones's graphic novel Our Lady of Birth Control, the author illustrates the incredible life of Margaret Sanger (1879-1966), framing the biography with her personal experiences of coming of age at the height of the sexual revolution.
During her lifetime, Sanger transformed herself from working class nurse to an exuberant free-lover and savvy manipulator of the media, the law, and her wealthy supporters. Through direct action, propaganda, exile, and imprisonment, she ultimately succeeded in bringing legal access to birth control to women of all classes. Sanger's revolutionary actions established organizations that eventually evolved into Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
Jones's autobiographical sections of Our Lady of Birth Control show her journey into activist art in response to the anti-feminist backlash of the Reagan era. From street theater and protest graphics to alternative comics, her path similarly follows in Margaret's footsteps, encountering versions of the same adversaries. Her striking imagery evokes the late 20th century, recalling the ashcan artists of The Masses, an acclaimed magazine of Sanger's formative years.

Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture.

We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched.

DARK NIGHT: A TRUE BATMAN STORY is the harrowing and eloquent autobiographical tale of Dini's courageous struggle to overcome a truly desperate situation. It is a Batman story like no other and one that will truly resonate with fans, with art by the incredible and talented Eduardo Risso (100 BULLETS,
DARK KNIGHT III: THE MASTER RACE).
In the 1990s, writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career penning the hugely popular Batman: The Animated Seriesand Tiny Toon Adventures. It was a golden era of television screenwriting, and Dini and his fellow writers were at the forefront of the glittering Hollywood scene. In one night, everything would change.
Walking home one evening, Dini was jumped and viciously beaten. With several broken bones and a shattered face, Dini experienced an arduous recovery process, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, constantly chivvying him along during his darkest moments.
While most know the Caped Crusader as the all-abiding icon of justice and authority, in this surprising story, we see Batman in a new light--not as the dark avenger, but the savior who helped a discouraged man recover mentally from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33252326-dark-night

health,Special Exits,Joyce Farmer,health,"Joyce Farmer's memoir chronicles the decline of the author's parents' health, their relationship with one another and with their daughter, and how they cope with the day-to-day emotional fragility of the most taxing time of their lives.
Elderly parents Lars and Rachel, who have enjoyed a long and loving married life together, are rendered in fine, confident pen lines. Set in southern Los Angeles (which makes for a terrifying sequence as blind Rachel and ailing Lars are trapped in their home without power during the 1992 Rodney King riots), backgrounds and props are lovingly detailed: these objects serve as memory triggers for Lars and Rachel, even as they eventually overwhelm them and their home, which the couple is loathe to leave. Special Exitsis laid out in an eight-panel grid, which creates a leisurely storytelling pace that not only helps to convey the slow, inexorable decline in Lars' and Rachel's health, but perfectly captures the timbre of the exchanges between a long-married couple: the affectionate bickering; their gallows humor; their querulousness as their bodies break down.
Though Lars and Rachel are the protagonists of Special Exits, Farmer makes her voice known through creative visual metaphors and in her indictment of the careless treatment of the elderly in nursing homes. Special Exitsgracefully deals with the hard reality of caring for aging loved ones: those who are or who have been in similar situations might find comfort in it, and those who haven't will find much to admire in the bravery and good humor of Lars and Rachel. Joyce Farmer, best known for co-creating the Tits 'n Clitscomics anthology in the 1970s, a feminist response to the rampant misogyny in underground comix, spent 11 years crafting Special Exits, a graphic memoir in the vein of Alison Bechdel's Fun Homeor Harvey Pekar, Joyce Brabner, and Frank Stack's Our Cancer Year, about caring for her dying father and stepmother.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8400446-special-exits

The book is meant to be a non-judgmental, comforting, even humorous look at what a woman can go through during an abortion. Although the subject matter is heavy, the illustrations are light.

""Abby Denson is a pioneer . . . doing something that few others have even thought of doing.""--Manga News
Inspired by shounen-ai manga--melodramatic Japanese comics by girls about gay boys--Tough Loveis a teen romance and coming-out story about a shy boy named Brian. More realistic than Japanese manga, this story centers on the relationships Brian develops with the boy he likes, Chris, and Julie, the girl who befriends him. Serious issues like gay bashing, suicide, and coming to terms with one's own sexual identity are depicted with an honest, gentle touch. Socially relevant, fun, immediately accessible, and a bit of a soap opera, Tough Lovehelps gay teenagers to be more comfortable with themselves and less troubled, especially when they're feeling alone and misunderstood.

health,Stitches,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6407014-stitches

The author of the perennial classic, Monsters (written as Ken Dahl), Gabby Schulz returns with a new graphic novel, Sick, which Hicksville author Dylan Horrocks calls ""a punch in the face and well worth reading."" Like Monsters, Sick focuses on health and social policy, this time expanding from the subject of STDs and their stigma to the larger, hot-button issue of national healthcare.
Severely ill, uninsured, alone, and confined to his bed for weeks, Schulz was left searching--only to find himself. Sick documents his discovery in gory, glorious, water-colored detail, finally completed and collected here for the first time in a beautiful, album-sized hardcover edition.
Since Monsters, Schulz has produced a host of online comics including SEXISM, a viral sensation written up everywhere from the Stranger to Scientific American. The web-serialized Sick was an Ignatz Award nominee for Outstanding Online Comic. His work has appeared on narrative.ly and BuzzFeed and in Arthur magazine.
Gabby Schulz, sometimes known as Ken Dahl, grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii. His graphic novel, Monsters won two Ignatz Awards, was an Eisner Award nominee, and was a Best American Comics selection. His other works include the collection Welcome to the Dahl Houseand the web comic Sick, an Ignatz Award nominee for Outstanding Online Comic.

health,"You'll Never Know, Vol. 3: Soldier's Heart",Carol Tyler,,"In one of the most eagerly-anticipated graphic novels of 2012, Soldier s Heart concludes the story of Carol Tyler and her delving into her father s war experiences in a way that is both surprising and devastating and rather than trying to summarize this episode and thus possibly spoil it for readers, we prefer to simply offer a selection of comments on the first two installments of this autobiographical masterpiece.
Publishers Weekly (Starred Review) In the first volume of Tyler s planned trilogy of graphic memoirs, she dug into the eruptive, violent memories of her father s WWII experiences while simultaneously dealing with a husband who decided to go find himself and leave her with a daughter to raise. [Book Two] is no less rich and overwhelming. Tyler gets back to the business of detailing her father s war stories difficult given that he is one of those guys who closed it off and never talked about it as well as coming to terms with her already touchy parents increasingly ornery attitudes. Closing the circle somewhat is Tyler s concern over her daughter s troubled nature, which seems to mirror her own wild past. While the language of Chicago-raised and Cincinnati-based Tyler has a winningly self-deprecating Midwestern spareness to it, her art is a lavishly prepared kaleidoscope of watercolors and finely etched drawings, all composed to look like the greatest family photo album of all time. The story s honest self-revelations and humane evocations of family dramas are tremendously moving. Tyler s book could well leave readers simultaneously eager to see the third volume, but also nervous about the traumas, home front and war front, that it might contain.
Booklist Tyler s fluid, expressive linework, complemented by subtly overlaid watercolors, gives ideal visual expression to a narrative that s at once sensitive and hard-nosed... Decades of drawing mostly autobiographical stories have honed her skills, enabling her to produce a work that ranks in quality with the graphic memoirs of Alison Bechdel (Fun Home)and Marjane Satrapi (Persepolis).",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13144466-you-ll-never-know-vol-3

Born in Alabama in 1900, she was only 18 when she met F. Scott Fitzgerald, an ambitious young writer who would turn into one the greatest American authors of all time.

health,"Ink in Water: An Illustrated Memoir (Or, How I Kicked Anorexia's Ass and Embraced Body Positivity)",Lacy J. Davis Jim Kettner,health disorder,"At once punk rock and poignant, Ink in Wateris the visceral and groundbreaking graphic memoir of a young woman's devastating struggle with negative body image and eating disorders, and how she rose above her own destructive behaviors and feelings of inadequacy to live a life of strength and empowerment.
As a young artist living in Portland, Lacy Davis' eating disorder began with the germ of an idea: a seed of a thought that told her she just wasn't good enough. And like ink in water, that idea spread until it reached every corner of her being. This is the true story of Lacy's journey into the self-destructive world of multiple eating disorders. It starts with a young and positive Lacy, trying to grapple with our culture's body-image obsession and stay true to her riot grrrl roots. And while she initially succeeds in overcoming a nagging rumination about her body, a break up with a recovering addict starts her on a collision course with anorexia, health food obsession, and compulsive exercise addiction. At the request of her last real friend, she starts going to a twelve-step Overeaters Anonymous course, only to find that it conflicts with her punk feminist ideology.
Blending bold humor, a healthy dose of self-deprecation, vulnerability, literary storytelling, and dynamic and provocative artwork by illustrator Jim Kettner, Ink in Wateris an unflinching, brutally honest look into the author's mind: how she learned to take control of her damaging thoughts, redirect her perfectionism from self-destructive behaviors into writing and art, and how she committed herself to a life of health, strength, and nourishment.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35443949-ink-in-water

She's suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and fighting violent urges to harm other people. But that's not who she really wants to be. Nao has dreams. She wants to quiet her unruly mind; she wants to get her design and illustration career off the ground; and she wants to find love, perfect love.
Nao's life continues to seesaw. Her boyfriend dumps her; a toy deal falls through. But she also meets Gregory, an interesting washing-machine repairman, and Ray, an art teacher at the Buddhist Center. She begins to draw and meditate to ease her mind and open her heart--and in doing so comes to a big realization: Life isn't black-and-white after all . . . it's much more like brown.
Praise for The Nao of Brown:
""Lushly rendered, passionately digressive"" --The New York Times
""Dillon turns in a narrative tour de force, featuring a script that works in perfect concert with almost cinematic art reminiscent of Milo Manara, but with far more expressive characters. A triumph of comics for grownups, this is a must-read.""--Publishers Weekly, starred review
""The art in The Nao of Brownis absolutely gorgeous . . . An intense story about a young woman who fights as hard to get out of her own head as some superheroes fight to save the world."" --The Onion's A.V. Club
""This was the best read I have had in a long time."" --Scott Stantis, cartoonist for theChicago Tribune 
""Dillon makes his grand return in what can only be described as a visual spectacle."" --The Beat
""Amazing artwork; a truly novelistic piece of storytelling, full of wisdom and compassion; and a book which is a beautiful artifact, a treat for those of a bibliophilic inclination."" --Comic Book Resources
""The battles are internal, but no less monumental for all of that. Such inner wars made Sandman a classic, and I have no doubt that Dillon's graphic novel will likewise be regarded as a seminal work in comic art."" --The Houston PressArt Attackblog
""Psychologically complex and surprising."" --Paste Magazine
""It's a masterpiece, and I really can't recommend it enough."" --Comic Book Resources
""Penciled and watercolored by hand, the pages glow with a lush realism, even in their darkest moments.

The graphic novel depicts Wojnarowicz's childhood of prostitution and drugs on the streets of Manhattan, through his adulthood living with AIDS, and his anger at the indifference of government and health agencies. Originally published as a comic book in 1996 by DC's Vertigo Comics, an imprint best-known for horror and fantasy material such as The Sandman, 7 Miles a Secondwas an instant critical success, but struggled to find an audience amongst the typical Vertigo readership. It has become a cult classic amongst fans of literary and art comics, just as Wojnarowicz's influence and reputation have widened in the larger art world. Romberger and Van Cook's visuals give stunning life to Wojnarowicz's words, blending the gritty naturalism of Lower East Side street life with a hallucinatory, psychedelic imagination that takes perfect advantage of the comics medium. This new edition will finally present the artwork as it was intended: oversized, and with Van Cook's elegant watercolors restored.

health,Haunted,Philippe Dupuy,,"A surprising, wry, and deeply moving reflection on despair and the way back out
Ten years after finishing the original French edition of Maybe Later--the book in which the French superstar cartooning duo Philippe Dupuy and Charles Berberian worked separately for the first time--Dupuy set out on his own again with Haunted. Gone are the tightly constructed narratives and urbane, elegant graphics of his projects with Berberian. In their place, roughed-in drawings give an urgent,
spontaneous feeling to a series of hallucinatory stories and dreamlike sequences that register the raw distress of solitude and self-doubt--the dark core of the material held in balance by Dupuy's acid humor and lyrical sensibility.
A jogging Dupuy runs around and sometimes through the stories of the misfit characters that haunt him: a self-amputating dog, a Left Bank artist in search of emptiness, an art-collecting duck, Lucha Libre wrestlers, and a group of single guys at the watering hole imagined as the anthropomorphic ""Forest Friends."" Heart pumping, gaze turned inward, the ground occasionally giving way beneath his feet, this alter ego concludes that sometimes you need to cross the line to figure out where it is.

health,Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?,Roz Chast,,"#1 New York TimesBestseller
2014 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST
In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594409-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

In H Day, her first graphic novel in four years, French explores, through metaphor and in pictures, her struggles with migraine headaches, marshaling troops of insects, beasts and humanoids to envision the processes that result in such hideous sensations. A sweeping, often tense narrative of invasion, repulsion and liberation, H Daycan be read both as an oblique autobiography and as a suspenseful fantasy story.

This graphic novel tracks Dunlap-Shohl's journey through depression, the worsening symptoms of the disease, the juggling of medications and their side effects, the impact on relations with family and community, and the raft of mental and physical changes wrought by the malady.
My Degenerationexamines the current state of Parkinson's care, including doctor/patient relations and the repercussions of a disease that, among other things, impairs movement, can rob patients of their ability to speak or write, degrades sufferers' ability to deal with complexity, and interferes with the sense of balance. Readers learn what it's like to undergo a dramatic, demanding, and audacious bit of high-tech brain surgery that can mysteriously restore much of a patient's control over symptoms. But My Degenerationis more than a Parkinson's memoir. Dunlap-Shohl gives the person newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease the information necessary to cope with it on a day-to-day basis. He chronicles the changes that life with the disease can bring to the way one sees the world and the way one is seen by the wider community.

As seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl named Una, it takes place in northern England in 1977, as the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer of prostitutes, is on the loose and creating panic among the townspeople. As the police struggle in their clumsy attempts to find the killer, and the headlines in the local paper become more urgent, a once self-confident Una teaches herself to ""lower her gaze"" in order to deflect attention from boys.
After she is ""slut-shamed"" at school for having birth control pills, Una herself is the subject of violent acts for which she comes to blame herself. But as the police finally catch up and identify the killer, Una grapples with the patterns of behavior that led her to believe she was to blame.
Becoming Unbecoming combines various styles, press clippings, photo-based illustrations, and splashes of color to convey Una's sense of confusion and rage, as well as sobering statistics on sexual violence against women. The book is a no-holds-barred indictment of sexual violence against women and the shame and blame of its victims that also celebrates the empowerment of those able to gain control over their selves and their bodies.
Una (a pseudonym) is an artist, academic, and comics creator. Becoming Unbecoming, which took seven years to create, is her first book. She lives in the United Kingdom.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28818824-becoming-unbecoming

Using her trademark mix of words and pictures to sharp effect, Marissa Moss presents the story of how she, her husband, and her three young sons struggled to maintain their sense of selves and wholeness as a family and how they continued on with everyday life when the earth shifted beneath their feet.
After returning home from a year abroad, Marissa's husband, Harvey, was diagnosed with ALS. The disease progressed quickly, and Marissa was soon consumed with caring for Harvey while trying to keep life as normal as possible for her young children. ALS stole the man who was her husband, the father of her children, and her best friend in less than 7 months.
This is not a story about the redemptive power of a terminal illness. It is a story of resilience--of how a family managed to survive a terrible loss and grow in spite of it. Although it's a sad story, it's powerfully told and ultimately uplifting as a guide to strength and perseverance, to staying connected to those who matter most in the midst of a bleak upheaval.

health,Vincent,Barbara Stok Camila Werner,,"Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) e sua mente torturada conceberam uma arte fascinante que transcendeu sua propria historia para se tornar um dos mais expressivos e maravilhosos conjuntos de pinturas jamais concebidos. Nesta graphic novel de tracos pop originalissimos, Barbara Stok retrata de forma delicada e luminosa os ultimos anos da vida do pintor holandes, passados na Franca, onde encontrou nao apenas seu fim, mas tambem a natureza e a luz que imortalizou em seus quadros.
Em 1888, apos uma estadia de dois anos em Paris, Vincent van Gogh muda-se para Arles, no sul da Franca. A luminosidade, os espacos abertos e as paisagens bucolicas da regiao, alem do proprio contato com a natureza, fornecem ao artista a materia-prima para aquela que e considerada a fase mais rica e revolucionaria de sua arte.
Se por um lado o ambiente o enche de contentamento e esperanca, por outro agravam-se seu desequilibrio e sua angustia, piorados ainda pela falta de dinheiro e de perspectivas concretas de futuro e pela culpa de ser um fardo para o irmao, Theo, que o sustentava financeiramente.
E esse turbulento e rico periodo, nao apenas crucial para a compreensao do genio Van Gogh como tambem emblematico de sua existencia, que a artista grafica Barbara Stok retrata, com um colorido e uma singeleza dignos do genio holandes. Barbara pinta com todas as cores um Vincent humano, com suas ambiguidades e fraquezas. Incorporando sabiamente trechos de cartas escritas ao irmao Theo e telas do proprio pintor, aborda seu processo criativo, suas ideias sobre pintura e a obcecada conviccao em sua propria arte, que sempre o guiou. O resultado e um personagem cativante, repleto de nuances, e que emociona por sua arte e tambem pela pureza da paixao com que a perseguia.
Barbara Stok nasceu em 1970 em Groningen, na Holanda. Trabalhou como fotografa e jornalista ate estrear, em 1998, com o livro de tiras Barbaraal tot op het bot, no qual retratava o proprio cotidiano.

health,Stitches: A Memoir,David Small,cancer,"Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award and finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards: the prize-winning children's author depicts a childhood from hell in this searing yet redemptive graphic memoir.
One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statement.
A silent movie masquerading as a book, Stitches renders a broken world suddenly seamless and beautiful again. Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award (Young Adult); finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards (Best Writer/Artist: Nonfiction; Best Reality-Based Work).",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13509102-stitches

Imagine descobrir que um amigo seu de escola acabou se transformando num dos mais temidos serial killers do seculo? Essa e a historia real que o quadrinista Derf Backderf relata na graphic novel Meu Amigo Dahmer. Meu Amigo Dahmer traz o perfil do psicopata Jeff Dahmer quando este ainda era um aluno do ensino medio. O autor do livro foi seu colega de turma nos anos 1970, e conviveu com o futuro ""canibal de Milwaukee"" com uma intimidade que Dahmer talvez so viesse a compartilhar novamente com suas vitimas. Juntos, Derf e Dahmer estudaram para provas, mataram aula, jogaram basquete. Os dois tomaram rumos diferentes, e Derf so voltaria a saber do amigo pelo noticiario, anos depois. Em 1991, os crimes de Jeffrey Dahmer vieram a tona: necrofilia, canibalismo e uma lista de pelo menos 17 mortos, entre homens adultos e garotos. O primeiro assassinato teria acontecido meses apos a formatura no colegio. Alem de remexer nos seus velhos cadernos e albuns de fotografia, Derf consultou seus amigos de adolescencia, antigos professores, os arquivos do fbi e a cobertura da midia apos a descoberta de seus crimes antes de roteirizar Meu Amigo Dahmer. Muitos tinham historias do garoto que costumava fingir surtos epilepticos, que exagerava na bebida antes mesmo de ir para a aula e que parecia ter uma fixacao em dissecar os animais atropelados que encontrava perto de casa. Mas quem realmente poderia prever os caminhos sombrios pelos quais ele seguiria? Seria possivel evitar tamanha tragedia?

Only it didn't. Vic's wife, Jeri, and older daughter, Rachael, were still very much alive, as were his two demanding careers. What did end was his worldview: one based on long-held assumptions and beliefs about life, death, disease, health, risk, and ultimate purpose-subjects on which he had been writing and speaking for years-but the validity of which he now questioned.
Vic's experience of being ""broken open"" (to take bestselling author Elizabeth Lesser's phrase) set him on a life transforming journey through ancient and modern philosophy, literature, psychology, neuroscience, and Egyptology. Along the way, Vic was introduced to an unlikely role model: a six-legged superhero whose unique relationship with a ball of excrement forever altered Vic's outlook. A self-help guide, college lecture, confessional, and time-travel adventure all rolled into one, On Purpose uses a beautiful, fantasy-fueled, graphic novel format to tell a story of self-discovery and personal growth you'll never forget.

""Once upon a cruddy time on a cruddy street on the side of a cruddy hill in the cruddiest part of a crudded-out town in a cruddy state, country, world, solar system, universe. The cruddy girl named Roberta was writing the cruddy book of her cruddy life and the name of the book was called Cruddy.
Now the truth can finally be revealed about the mysterious day long ago when the authorities found a child, calmly walking in the boiling desert, covered with blood. She could not give the authorities any information about why she was the only survivor and everyone else was lying around in hacked-up pieces.""
Roberta Rohbeson, 1971. Her overblown, drug-induced teenage rant against a world bounded by ""the cruddy top bedroom of a cruddy rental house on a very cruddy mud road behind cruddy Black Cat Lumber"" soon becomes a detailed account of another story. It is a story about which Roberta has kept silent for five years, until, under the influence of a pale hippie called the Turtle and a drug called Creeper, her tale giddily unspools...
Roberta Rohbeson, 1967. The world of Roberta, age eleven, is terrifyingly unbounded, a one-way cross-country road trip fueled by revenge and by greed, a violent, hallucinatory, sometimes funny, more often horrific year of killings, betrayals, arson, and a sinister set of butcher knives, each with its own name.
Welcome to ""Cruddy,"" Lynda Barry's masterful tale of the two intertwinednarratives set five years -- an eternity -- apart, which form the backbone of Roberta's life. ""Cruddy"" is a wild ride indeed, a fairy tale-""cum""-low-budget horror movie populated by a cast of characters that will remain vivid in the reader's mind long after the final page: Roberta's father, a dangerous alcoholic and out-of-work meat cutter in search of his swindled inheritance; the frightening owners of the Knocking Hammer Bar and sometime slaughterhouse; and two charming but quite mad escapees from the Barbara V. Herrmann Home for Adolescent Rest. Written with a teenager's eye for freakish detail and a nervous ability to make the most horrible scenes seem hilarious, Roberta's two stories -- part ""Easy Rider"" and part bipolar ""Wizard of Oz"" -- painfully but inevitably converge in a surprising denouement in a nightmarish Dreamland in the Nevada desert.
By turns terrifying, darkly funny, and resonant with humanity, propelled by all the narrative power of a superior thriller and burnished by the author's pitch-perfect ear for dialogue, ""Cruddy"" is a stunning achievement.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1182947.Cruddy

Since 2008, Miller and Bley have held an open call for young people to create comics that address a variety of topics involved with sex education. We have since produced several issues of a sex-ed comic called Not Your Mother's Meatloaf. The work is chosen from a vastly varied group of submissions and attempts to challenge hetero and gender normative practices in sex education. The comics address topics like body image, safer sex, consent, and relationships, from positions that have historically been left out of sex education.

health,Fetch: How a Bad Dog Brought Me Home,Nicole J. Georges,depression,"From an award-winning artist, a memoir of life with a difficult, beloved dog that will resonate with anybody who has ever had a less than perfectly behaved pet
When Nicole Georges was sixteen she adopted Beija, a dysfunctional shar-pei/corgi mix--a troublesome combination of tiny and attack, just like teenaged Nicole herself. For the next fifteen years, Beija would be the one constant in her life. Through depression, relationships gone awry, and an unmoored young adulthood played out against the backdrop of the Portland punk scene, Beija was there, wearing her ""Don't Pet Me"" bandana. Georges's gorgeous graphic novel Fetch chronicles their symbiotic, codependent relationship and probes what it means to care for and be responsible to another living thing--a living thing that occasionally lunges at toddlers. Nicole turns to vets, dog whisperers, and even a pet psychic for help, but it is the moments of accommodation, adaption, and compassion that sustain them. Nicole never successfully taught Beija ""sit,"" but in the end, Beija taught Nicole how to stay.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30971765-fetch

Burdened by unmet comics deadlines and high rent, our narrator and his wife know they must make a change. Convinced the absence of traffic noise will ease his writer's block, our pair welcomes the idea of building a life from scratch. Deciding on a home atop an uninhabited mountain, they excitedly embrace the charms of their new rural existence.
From tending to the land and attempting grocery runs through snow, to the complexities of fighting depression in seclusion, the move does not immediately prove to be the golden ticket they'd hoped for, and the silence of the mountain poses as much of an obstacle to output as the sirens of the city. Through it all, though, we see simple pleasures seep in and gain prominence over these commercial, and, often, comparatively trivial worries: the smell of the forest, the calming weight of enveloping snow, and the gratification of a stripped down life making art begin to muffle other concerns.
Originally published in Korean to great acclaim and winning the Manhwa Today award, Uncomfortably, Happilyuniquely explores our narrator's inner world. Hong propels the comic with gorgeously detailed yet simple art, sharing the story of two lives unfolding slowly, sometimes uncomfortably, yet ultimately, happily.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29875903-uncomfortably-happily

health,Vincent,Barbara Stok,,"Het bewogen leven van Vincent van Gogh blijft een onuitputtelijke inspiratiebron. Stripmaker Barbara Stok neemt in dit verhaal de lezer mee naar de korte, intense periode die de schilder in Zuid-Frankrijk doorbrengt.
Vincent droomt ervan in Arles een kunstenaarshuis te stichten voor zichzelf en zijn artistieke vrienden. Maar door aanvallen waarin hij volledig in de war is, uitmondend in het beruchte oorincident, valt die droom in duigen. Zijn broer Theo blijft hem onvoorwaardelijk steunen.
Van Gogh was een kunstenaar vol hartstocht voor zijn vak. Zijn ideeen over succes, tegenslag en een zinvol leven vormen een interessant tegenwicht in onze tijd van individualisme, maakbaarheid en economisch denken. Zo maakt Stok van de belevenissen van deze 19de-eeuwse schilder weer een actueel verhaal.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16111980-vincent

health,The Sculptor,Scott McCloud,,"David Smith is giving his life for his art--literally. Thanks to a deal with Death, the young sculptor gets his childhood wish: to sculpt anything he can imagine with his bare hands. But now that he only has 200 days to live, deciding whatto create is harder than he thought, and discovering the love of his life at the 11th hour isn't making it any easier!
This is a story of desire taken to the edge of reason and beyond; of the frantic, clumsy dance steps of young love; and a gorgeous, street-level portrait of the world's greatest city. It's about the small, warm, human moments of everyday life...and the great surging forces that lie just under the surface.

health,¿Podemos hablar de algo más agradable? (KF8),Roz Chast,,"In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27242454-podemos-hablar-de-algo-m-s-agradable
health,Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too: A Book,Jomny Sun,,"The illustrated story of a lonely alien sent to observe Earth, where he meets all sorts of creatures with all sorts of perspectives on life, love, and happiness, while learning to feel a little better about himself--based on the enormously popular Twitter account.
Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.
The characters are unique and inventive--bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny's curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.
Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Toois also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider's perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naive voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.
Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all the earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we will all learn how sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35262509-everyone-s-a-aliebn-when-ur-a-aliebn-too

- Matt Haig, bestselling author of Reasons to Stay Alive
A groundbreaking picture book on depression with stunning illustrations. 
With stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori examines how depression affects one's whole outlook upon life, and shows that there can be an escape - it may not be easy to find, but it is there. Drawn from Debi's own experiences and with a moving testimony at the end of the book explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope, Debi hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.
'I have used dragons to represent depression. This is partly because of their legendary ability to turn a once fertile realm into a blackened, smoking ruin and partly because popular mythology shows them as monstrous opponents with a tendency to pick fights with smaller creatures. I'm not particularly brave or resourceful, and after so many years battling my beasts, I have to admit to a certain weariness, but I will arm-wrestle dragons for eternity if it means that I can help anyone going through a similar struggle.'",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32574766-night-shift

David B. was born Pierre-Francois Beauchard in a small town near Orleans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.
Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Francois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Francois's grandparents and we relive his grandfathers' experiences in both World Wars.

Praise for The Nao of Brown:
""Lushly rendered, passionately digressive"" --The New York Times
""Dillon turns in a narrative tour de force, featuring a script that works in perfect concert with almost cinematic art reminiscent of Milo Manara, but with far more expressive characters. A triumph of comics for grownups, this is a must-read.""--Publishers Weekly, starred review
""The art in The Nao of Brownis absolutely gorgeous . . . An intense story about a young woman who fights as hard to get out of her own head as some superheroes fight to save the world."" --The Onion's A.V. Club
""This was the best read I have had in a long time."" --Scott Stantis, cartoonist for theChicago Tribune 
""Dillon makes his grand return in what can only be described as a visual spectacle."" --The Beat
""Amazing artwork; a truly novelistic piece of storytelling, full of wisdom and compassion; and a book which is a beautiful artifact, a treat for those of a bibliophilic inclination."" --Comic Book Resources
""The battles are internal, but no less monumental for all of that. Such inner wars made Sandman a classic, and I have no doubt that Dillon's graphic novel will likewise be regarded as a seminal work in comic art."" --The Houston PressArt Attackblog
""Psychologically complex and surprising."" --Paste Magazine
""It's a masterpiece, and I really can't recommend it enough."" --Comic Book Resources

Fighting dragons is one way of fighting depression. This book is another.
Through stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori provides a fascinating and absorbing portrait of depression and hope in Night Shift, a moving picture book about a young girl haunted by dragons. The young girl battles the dragons using 'night skills': skills that give her both the ability to survive inside her own darkness and the knowledge that nothing--not even long, dark nights filled with monsters--will last forever.
Drawn from Gliori's own experiences and struggles with depression, the book concludes with a moving author's note explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope. Gliori hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.
A brave and powerful book, give Night Shift to dragon fighters young and old, and any reader who needs to know they're not alone.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34915616-night-shift

A string of his bestselling books show an engaged, sympathetic gentleman hoping to share these strange, hidden delights with the rest of the world. He was willing to go deeper than any outsider had before. But, of course, there was a dark side. Seabrook was a barely functioning alcoholic who was deeply obsessed with bondage and the so-called mystical properties of pain and degradation. His life was a series of traveling highs and drunken lows; climbing on and falling off the wagon again and again. What led the popular and vivid writer to such a sad state?
Cartoonist Joe Ollmann spent seven years researching Seabrook's life, interviewing surviving family and accessing long neglected archives, in order to piece together the peripatetic life of a forgotten American writer. Often weaving in Seabrook's own words and those of his biographers, Ollmann's The Abominable Mr. Seabrook posits Seabrook the believer versus Seabrook the exploiter, and leaves the reader to consider where one ends and the other begins.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29875927-the-abominable-mr-seabrook

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.
A work of great bravery and humanity, Stitchesis a gripping and ultimately redemptive story of a man's struggle to understand the past and reclaim his voice.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7440306-stitches

health,Stitches,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9440024-stitches

He attempts to maintain a balancing act between his seizure triggers and his day-to-day schedule, but he finds that nothing--not even his medication--seems to work. The doctors won't listen, the schoolwork keeps piling up, his family is in denial about his condition, and his social life falls apart as he feels more and more isolated by his illness.

After having been a good girl and following her mother's advice to snag a husband before she became a twenty-something spinster, Barbara Slate realized that her Mr. Right was actually Mr. Wrong and that she was living her life according to everyone's rules but her own. After twelve years of an unblissful marriage, she made her escape.
Now this accomplished comic artist lets it all out in a savagely funny and emotionally honest fictional narrative. Jo, her stand-in protagonist, is a successful wedding photographer (of all things) who has been dumped by her husband and desperately needs to get on with her life. She follows her friends' advice to get laid, see a shrink, go out more, and live a little. Nothing works. Eventually she realizes that she must stop listening to what everybody else tells her and follow her own voice instead.
Jo's struggle with female guilt and her quest for self-awareness, told in a series of hilarious panels, is the perfect book for any woman needing to take back control of her life, or remembering when she did.

The Caped Crusader has been the all-abiding icon of justice and authority for generations. But in this surprising original graphic novel, we see Batman in a new light--as the savior who helps a discouraged man recover from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.
In the 1990s, legendary writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career writing the hugely popular Batman: The Animated Seriesand Tiny Toon Adventures. Walking home one evening, he was jumped and viciously beaten within an inch of his life. His recovery process was arduous, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television including the Joker, Harley Quinn and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, chivvying him along during his darkest moments.
A gripping graphic memoir of one writer's traumatic experience and his deep connection with his creative material, DARK NIGHT: A TRUE BATMAN STORY is an original graphic novel that will resonate profoundly with fans.

health,Stitches: A Memoir,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statement.

Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.
The characters are unique and inventive--bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny's curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.
Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Toois also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider's perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naive voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.
Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all the earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we will all learn how sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32497573-everyone-s-a-aliebn-when-ur-a-aliebn-too

What I Hateis an A to Z of epic horrors and daily unpleasantries, including but by no means limited to rabies, abduction, tunnels, and the triple-layered terror of Jell-O 1-2-3. With never-before-published, full-page cartoons for every letter, and supplemental text to make sure the proper fear is instilled in every heart, Chast's alphabetical compendium will resonate with anyone well-versed in the art of avoidance- and make an instructive gift for anyone who might be approaching life with unhealthy unconcern.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11304750-what-i-hate
health,El escultor,Scott McCloud,,"David Smith esta dispuesto a morir por su obra... literalmente. Gracias a un trato con la Muerte, este joven escultor consigue cumplir su gran deseo de la infancia: ser capaz de esculpir, unicamente con las manos, cualquier cosa que imagine.

Romantic and exuberant, with four loving children, Brian was everything a woman could possibly want, and Roz fell deeply in love. But soon Roz began to notice troublesome signs that Brian was not what he seemed. A pattern of small lies and petty cruelties emerged which, over the course of their relationship, would encompass a litany of verbal, emotional, sexual, and physical abuse truly appalling in its scope and malevolence.
Often too traumatized and ashamed to admit the true extent of what she was experiencing, Roz instead poured her anguish into a series of graphic diaries. The result is a touching, profoundly shocking, and completely original portrait of domestic abuse.
An extraordinary visual testimony, Dragonslipperspresents the many warning signs of abuse and offers a frank examination of the psychology of both abusers and victims.

Julie Delporte's Everywhere Antennas is a deeply affecting, sparely constructed novel, equal parts Waldenand The Bell Jar. Told in the first person, it offers diary-like entries from an anonymous narrator who is undergoing a nervous breakdown and struggling to hold together a failing relationship. In soft, flowing colored pencil, Delporte shows her narrator coming to terms with a rare and misunderstood sensitivity to the radiation emitted by the televisions, cell phones, and computers that permeate urban life.
On each page a few words are paired with an image or two, conveying a moment or a thought simply but effectively. Over the course of the book, the anonymous narrator moves from place to place, looking for solutions to her melancholy in the countryside via isolation and in the city with friends, sometimes turning to medication for answers. Throughout, her emotional and intellectual landscape receives as much attention as her physical surroundings.
Everywhere Antennasis the portrait of a woman caught in the margins, struggling to balance the demands of technology and modern life with the need to find meaningful relationships and work. Roughly hewn figures, sketched in pencil crayon on brightly contrasting backgrounds, populate the pages of this flowing, emotive work. With Everywhere Antennas, Delporte proves herself a master craftswoman of heartbreakingly personal, beautifully literary graphic fiction.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18465544-everywhere-antennas

In his most ambitious book to date, Nate Powell quietly explores the dark corners of adolescence -- not the cliched melodramatic outbursts of rebellion, but the countless tiny moments of madness, the vague relief of medication, and mixed blessing of family ties. As the story unfolds, two stepsiblings hold together amidst schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, family breakdown, animal telepathy, misguided love, and the tiniest hope that everything will someday make sense.

It was the greatly admired Winston Churchill, a depression sufferer for much of his life, who nicknamed this human condition ""Black Dog.""
Living with a Black Dogis perhaps the most useful book ever created about depression. In simple text and strongly supportive illustrations, this slim volume examines, explains, and demystifies one of the most widespread and debilitating problems afflicting modern society.
Whether you've struggled with your own Black Dog for years, wondered why you're feeling sort of ""ruff"" lately, or known someone shadowed by a dark canine, Living with a Black Dogis for you. Artist and writer Matthew Johnstone, a depression sufferer himself, delivers a moving and uplifting insight into life with this unsavory companion. Even better, the book shows the strength and support to be found within and around us to tame this shaggy beast and ultimately bring it to heel.
Johnstone's book doesn't pretend to have all the answers. It doesn't resort to simple ""dog tricks"" for dealing with depression. But Living with a Black Dogdoes deliver understanding, hope, and the assurance that Black Dog days are not forever.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96202.Living_with_a_Black_Dog

First Year Healthypurports to be the story of a young woman, recently released from the hospital after an outburst, and her burgeoning relationship with an odd, perhaps criminal Turkish immigrant. In a scant forty-five pages, working with a vibrant, otherworldly palette of magentas, yellows, and grays, Michael DeForge brings to life a world whose shifting realities are as treacherous as the thin ice its narrator walks on. First Year Healthyis all it appears to be and more: a parable about mental illness, a folktale about magical cats, and a bizarre, compelling story about relationships.

Many cultures have come a long way from prohibiting masturbation - by way of a microscope - or homosexuality - a 'perversion' once comparable to cannibalism - while others continue to condemn promiscuous behaviour, particularly of women.

--Michelle Alexander
More than 2 million people are now imprisoned in the United States, producing the highest rate of incarceration in the world. How did this happen? As the director of The Sentencing Project, Marc Mauer has long been one of the country's foremost experts on sentencing policy, race, and the criminal justice system. His book Race to Incarceratehas become the essential text for understanding the exponential growth of the U.S. prison system; Michelle Alexander, author of the bestselling The New Jim Crow, calls it ""utterly indispensable."" Now, Sabrina Jones, a member of the World War 3 Illustratedcollective and an acclaimed author of politically engaged comics, has collaborated with Mauer to adapt and update the original book into a vivid and compelling comics narrative. Jones's dramatic artwork adds passion and compassion to the complex story of the penal system's shift from rehabilitation to punishment and the ensuing four decades of prison expansion, its interplay with the devastating ""War on Drugs,"" and its corrosive effect on generations of Americans.
With a preface by Mauer and a foreword by Alexander, Race to Incarcerate: A Graphic Retellingpresents a compelling argument about mass incarceration's tragic impact on communities of color--if current trends continue, one of every three black males and one of every six Latino males born today can expect to do time in prison. The race to incarcerate is not only a failed social policy, but also one that prevents a just, diverse society from flourishing.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13236016-race-to-incarcerate

Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.
David B. was born Pierre-Francois Beauchard in a small town near Orleans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.
Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Francois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Francois's grandparents and we relive his grandfathers' experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-Francois through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe""s losing battle with epilepsy.

It secured the cartoonist's place as one of his generation's most skillful and ambitious practitioners, and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family.
Mother, Come Homequietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Thomas, protected by a lion's mask that his mother gave him, constructs an identity for himself as ""the groundskeeper"": ritual and routine, already important to children that age, become paramount to him. He struggles desperately to keep up appearances while his father, a professor of symbolic logic, becomes lost in abstractions. Father and son begin to retreat into their fantasies, but only one emerges.
Mother, Come Homeis masterfully drawn: Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier's controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David's inexorable descent into utter despair.

In contrast to her last book, which was a full-length graphic memoir, The Infinite Wait is not a sustained narrative, but rather a collection of three short stories or graphic novellas. The stories in this collection contain Wertz's signature acerbic wit, ribald humour and keen eye for the everyday, but they also find the cartoonist delving into the personal. ""Industry"" catalogues 25 years of alternately terrible and terrific jobs, from selling golf balls, feeding and failing to feed animals, waitressing, and finally to cartooning and the publication of her first book. ""A Strange and Curious Place"" is a love letter to Wertz's hometown library; its mysteries and revelations, and its ability foster growth, rebellion and even artistic affirmation. The most sustained narrative in the collection, the eponymous ""The Infinite Wait,"" chronicles Wertz's move from her small hometown to San Francisco, her diagnosis with an incurable, auto-immune disease and her subsequent discovery of comics and comic making.
The collection's title, The Infinite Wait and Other Stories, intentionally and ironically recalls the vacuous and pretentious book titles of the literary elite, but these stories are the polar opposite of pretension. They are comics born out of illness, but not defined by it, and they are filled with the sometimes messy, heartbreaking and hilarious moments that make up a life.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16006353-the-infinite-wait-and-other-stories

Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture.

We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.

The Caped Crusader has been the all-abiding icon of justice and authority for generations. But in this surprising original graphic novel, we see Batman in a new light--as the savior who helps a discouraged man recover from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world.
In the 1990s, legendary writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career writing the hugely popular Batman: The Animated Seriesand Tiny Toon Adventures. Walking home one evening, he was jumped and viciously beaten within an inch of his life. His recovery process was arduous, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television including the Joker, Harley Quinn and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, chivvying him along during his darkest moments.
A gripping graphic memoir of one writer's traumatic experience and his deep connection with his creative material, DARK NIGHT: A TRUE BATMAN STORY is an original graphic novel that will resonate profoundly with fans.

Everything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.
Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched.

health,Special Exits,Joyce Farmer Ledvinska F. R.,health,"Joyce Farmer's memoir chronicles the decline of the author's parents' health, their relationship with one another and with their their daughter, and how they cope with the day-to-day emotional fragility of the most taxing time of their lives.
Elderly parents Lara and Rachel, who have enjoyed a long and loving married life together, are rendered in fine, confident pen lines. Set in southern Los Angeles (which makes for a terrifying sequence as blind Rachel and ailing Lars are trapped in their home without power during the 1992 Rodney King riots), backgrounds and props are lovingly detailed: these objects serve as memory triggers for Lars and Rachel, even as they eventually overwhelm them and their home, which the couple is loathe to leave. Special Exitsis laid out in an eight-panel grid, which creates a leisurely storytelling pace that not only helps to convey the slow, inexorable decline in Lars'
and Rachel's health, but perfectly captures the timbre of the exchanges between a long-married couple: the affectionate bickering; their gallows humor; their querulousness as their bodies break down.
Though Lars and Rachel are the protagonists of Special Exits, Farmer makes her voice known through creative visual metaphors and in her indictment of the careless treatment of the elderly in nursing homes. Special Exits gracefully deals with the hard reality of caring for aging loved ones: those who are or who have been in similar situations might find comfort in it, and those who haven't will find much to admire in the bravery and good humor of Lars and Rachel.
Joyce Farmer, best known for co-creating the Tits 'n Clitscomics anthology in the 1970s, a feminist response to the rampant misogyny in underground comix, spent 11 years crafting Special Exits, a graphic memoir in the vein of Alison Bechdel's Fun Homeor Harvey Pekar, Joyce Brabner, and Frank Stack's Our Cancer Year, about caring for her dying father and stepmother.
Lars e Rachel sono due coniugi che affrontano la parte finale della propria vita - la vecchiaia, la malattia, la morte - accuditi con premurosa attenzione dalla figlia. Joyce Farmer racconta semplicemente cio che ha vissuto prendendosi cura dei suoi genitori, concentrandosi sui dettagli della routine quotidiana, nello scorrere dei giorni e degli anni, creando un commovente ritratto di famiglia, dove non mancano momenti difficili, drammatici, ma neanche l'ironia dell'intimita. In questo memoir grafico, realistico e senza sentimentalismi, creato in 10 anni di lavoro, l'autrice mostra la fragilita del periodo piu difficile della vita, senza mai tirarsi indietro davanti agli imbarazzanti oltraggi della vecchiaia, con il lento decadere dei corpi e la mente che si confonde facilmente, non dimenticando il contesto di questa narrazione domestica fatta di frustrazioni e tenerezze: il presente nel South Los Angeles anni '80 e '90 e gli States della prima meta del '900 ricordati dai suoi genitori.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35535098-special-exits

The Making Ofis the follow-up to international sensation Brecht Evens's Eisner-nominated debut, The Wrong Place. With lush watercolors and his characteristic wit, Evens details the fumbling, amateurish foibles of the participants of a small art festival in the Flemish countryside.
Pieterjan is invited to the festival as an honored guest. From the moment he arrives, things start going wrong, and since no one seems ready to step in, Pieterjan takes over the show. He decides to build a giant garden gnome as a symbol of Flemish identity, but the construction process brings buried tensions to the surface as the other artists become jealous of Pieterjan's authority. In The Making Of, Evens delves deep into the petty tensions, small misunderstandings, and deadpan humor that pervade modern relationships.
With a keen eye for the subtleties of body language, Evens's The Making Of builds on the iconic visual style showcased in The Wrong Place.

When Jennifer Hayden was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 43, she realized that her tits told a story. Across a lifetime, they'd held so many meanings: hope and fear, pride and embarrassment, life and death. And then they were gone. Now, their story has become a way of understanding her story. Growing up flat-chested and highly aware of her inadequacies... heading off to college, where she ""bloomed"" in more ways than one... navigating adulthood between her mother's mastectomy, her father's mistress, and her musician boyfriend's problems of his own--not to mention his sprawling family. Then the kids come along... As cancer strikes three different lives, some relationships crumble while others emerge even stronger, and this sarcastic child of the '70s finally finds a goddess she can believe in.
For everyone who's faced cancer personally, or watched a loved one fight that battle, Hayden's story is a much-needed breath of fresh air, an irresistible blend of sweetness and skepticism.

health,"Thunder and Lightning: Weather Past, Present and Future",Lauren Redniss,,"A howling wind, a thunderstorm, the beating sun - it's with the elements that nature shows its true force and wonder.
In Thunder and Lightning, Guggenheim fellow and Pulitzer nominee Lauren Redniss draws a new account of the weather. She has travelled from the frozen archipelagos of the Arctic Ocean to the 'absolute desert' of Atacoma, Chile, to show us the elements at their most extreme. Along the way, through interviews and research, she has unearthed curious stories of exploration, savagery and coincidence - stories which show us how weather has shaped humanity, intervened in the course of history, and how mankind, in turn, has tried to bend the weather to its ends.
A book of exquisite beauty, with each illustration etched and coloured by hand, Thunder and Lightning informs, charms and transports. A combination of art and cultural history, from an uncategorisable and unique creative spirit, it will leave readers looking at the wind, the sun and the rain with new eyes.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25493814-thunder-and-lightning

health,Are You My Mother?,Alison Bechdel,,"Alison Bechdel's Fun Home was a literary phenomenon: 'an extraordinarily intimate account of family secrets that manages to be shocking, unsettling and life-affirming at the same time', as Sarah Walters wrote in the Guardian. The Times said it was 'incontestibly the graphic book of the year', while the Observer recently chose it as one of the ten best graphic novels ever published.
WhileFun Home explored Bechdel's relationship with her father, a closeted homsexual, this new memoir is about her mother - a voracious reader, a music lover, a passionate amateur actor. Also a woman, unhappily married to a gay man, whose artistic aspirations simmered under the surface of Bechdel's childhood... and who stopped touching or kissing her daughter goodnight, for ever, when she was seven. Poignantly, hilariously, Bechdel embarks on a quest for answers concerning the mother-daughter gulf.
It's a richly layered search that leads readers from the fascinating life and work of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott to one explosively illuminating Dr Seuss illustration, to Bechdel's own (serially monogamous) love life. And, finally, back to Mother - to a truce, fragile and real-time, that will move and astonish all adult children of gifted mothers.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14844432-are-you-my-mother

Searching to make sense of the popular concept of the crazy artist, she finds inspiration from the lives and work of other artists and writers who suffered from mood disorders, including Vincent van Gogh, Georgia O'Keeffe, William Styron, and Sylvia Plath.

Levando alimentos para os mais diversos paises do planeta, ele vera que sua tarefa pode ser mais complicada do que pensou, e suas acoes provocarao respostas diferentes em cada lugar que chegar.
Positivo/Negativo: Lancado nos Estados Unidos em 1998, e no Brasil em 1999, Super-Homem - Paz na Terra e uma edicao luxuosa no formato 24,5 x 34 cm, feita como parte das comemoracoes dos 60 anos de criacao do Homem de Aco. E, como tal, traz mensagens e simbolismos diferentes do que se costuma ver na serie mensal do personagem.
Voce ja viu o Super-Homem lutando contra monstros, alienigenas e robos, mas sempre surgia a pergunta: por que nao atacar as verdadeiras mazelas do mundo?
Fome, guerra, corrupcao, violencia e desigualdade social sao terriveis problemas que a humanidade nao consegue resolver e, infelizmente, por causa do proprio homem. Nesta edicao, o leitor encontrara uma resposta para esse questionamento.
Esqueca as grandes sagas, com reviravoltas mirabolantes. A trama e mais pessoal, narrada em primeira pessoa pelo proprio Homem de Aco, e com o objetivo de passar uma mensagem bastante clara e direta: nao se pode depender de alguem.
Uma unica pessoa nao pode resolver tudo, ainda mais quando se trata de assunto tao delicado. Seja ele um super-heroi com capa vermelha, o presidente de seu pais, o prefeito de sua cidade ou o sindico de seu predio, sentar e deixar que resolvam as coisas por voce jamais funcionara, se nao houver a ajuda de todos os demais.
Essa pessoa, retratada aqui como o Super-Homem, serve para aquilo que realmente deve servir: uma fonte de inspiracao para a propria humanidade, dar o exemplo e esperar que mais se juntem a ele.
Alem disso, as criticas sao evidentes, como a ma distribuicao de riquezas, retratadas desde pessoas com boa condicao que evitam mendigos nas ruas ate ditadores que deixam seu povo na penuria para manter o controle. Outra e voltada aos paises do primeiro mundo, que produzem mais do que gastam e, mesmo assim, desperdicam todo esse alimento extra em vez de ajudar quem nao tem o que comer.
Algumas das passagens sao emblematicas, como o heroi chegando ao Rio de Janeiro com o Cristo Redentor ao fundo - tracando um obvio paralelo visual entre as duas figuras -; e a cena final, na qual o Super-Homem sai de cena e Clark Kent comeca a fazer a sua parte ao passar adiante o conhecimento que seu pai o ensinou.

After his fiancee dies during the 9/11 attacks, the question plagues Aaron Goodman. It makes him give up his career as a doctor to become an interrogator/torturer at Guantanamo Bay. And yet, he's still no less obsessed. He begins overseeing experiments of how meme theory might program people into becoming suicide bombers. (Could there be a science behind terrorism?) Still nothing - until he meets Ahmed, a Gitmo prisoner who might know how the jihadists are using a variation of meme theory in their camps.
To finally learn the truth, Aaron and Ahmed's search will take them from Gitmo to the jihadist camps in Pakistan right back to Ground Zero in New York City. But where do Ahmed's real loyalties lie, and will Aaron's exploration into terrorist camps make him as much of a threat as those he's protecting his country against?",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8975264-aaron-and-ahmed

trauma,Daddy's Girl,Debbie Drechsler,,"Fantagraphics Books is proud to re-release one of the most powerful and moving books in its distinguished publishing history: Debbie Drechsler's first collection of short comic stories, Daddy's Girl. Originally published in 1995 and distributed only to comic book specialty stores, Daddy's Girlwas ahead of its time: Two years before The Kiss, Kathryn Harrison's critically acclaimed story of her incestuous relationship with her father, Dreschler's account of her abuse at the hands of her father, told from the point of view of an adolescent, is one of the most searingly honest, empathetic, and profoundly disturbing uses of the comics medium in its history.
Rendered entirely in black and white, Drechsler's meticulous brush lines gather into heavy textures that suggest the claustrophobic tension of the environment that threatens her pre-teen and adolescent female protagonists. Characters such as Lily, who can't escape her father's abuse, and Franny, a girl whose desire to be accepted leads her into dangerous territory, struggle not to be visually and emotionally overwhelmed. Both girls are rendered in chunky, rounded lines, as if they've been shaped by the oppressive weight of their blandly suburban milieu, where pretending that everything is all right and maintaining the status quo is prized above truth and upheaval. However, Drechsler's characters also have wide-open eyes, suggesting that they still maintain their innocence, and their world does contain some beauty and hope, as long as the characters have the resolve to look for it: art and creation is offered as a form of salvation. Central to this quasi-memoir is Lily's relationship to her father--a confused jumble of fear, trepidation, and love.
Drechsler's book was nominated for an Ignatz award the year it was released, and she went on to create the critically acclaimed The Summer of Love. With the critical and commercial success of mature and uncompromising works by women cartoonists such as Fun Home, Squirrel Mother, and Persepolis, Daddy's Girlshould receive serious media attention and find a responsive readership.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968975.Daddy_s_Girl

Everything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.
Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched.

Una pagina vergognosa e rimossa del nostro passato: i campi di internamento dove l'Italia deporto e lascio morire migliaia di cittadini sloveni. Un folle progetto di pulizia etnica, narrato attraverso lo sguardo e i dialoghi di due bambini.
Una tragedia rimossa e dimenticata. Una pagina vergognosa della nostra storia. Davide Toffolo fa rivivere a fumetti la memoria di circa 300mila cittadini sloveni rastrellati e deportati in vari campi di concentramento in Italia dal regime fascista di Mussolini a partire dall'autunno del 1941. In questo toccante volume a fumetti l'autore prende spunto dalla storia del campo friulano di Gonars, in provincia di Udine, dove nel corso del 1942 furono internati migliaia di sloveni nel quadro di un terribile progetto di ""pulizia etnica"" dei vicini territori jugoslavi programmato dal nazifascismo. Circa 800 persone morirono nell'anno di attivita di campo, soprattutto di malattie dovute alle precarie condizioni igieniche. Attraverso lo sguardo ingenuo e spaventato e le voci narranti di due bambini, che nel dolore di Gonars costruiscono la loro amicizia, Toffolo ripercorre settant'anni dopo questa vicenda finora poco nota. Il mio lavoro non e una cronaca o un reportage - spiega l'autore - ma una storia che si ispira a fatti veri: una riflessione sulla tragedia della deportazione, sulla pulizia etnica, sul piano folle degli italiani durante la Seconda guerra mondiale. I fatti sono quelli dell'epoca, filtrati attraverso la mia immaginazione e il mio amore per i fumetti, riletti con un approccio che ha debiti con Charles Schultz, Jules Feiffer e Debeurme, solo per fare qualche esempio"".Non esistono molti documenti fotografici della storia di Gonars, ma restano i disegni dei tanti artisti sloveni che furono internati nel campo.

Cartoonist Sarah Glidden accompanies her two friends--reporters and founders of a journalism non-profit--as they research potential stories on the effects of the Iraq War on the Middle East and, specifically, the war's refugees. Joining the trio is a childhood friend and former Marine whose past service in Iraq adds an unexpected and sometimes unwelcome viewpoint, both to the people they come across and perhaps even themselves.
As the crew works their way through Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, Glidden observes the reporters as they ask civilians, refugees, and officials, ""Who are you?"" Everyone has a story to tell: the Iranian blogger, the United Nations refugee administrator, a taxi driver, the Iraqi refugee deported from the US, the Iraqis seeking refuge in Syria, and even the American Marine.

Everything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.
Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched. The zany art and probing text do an extraordinary job of simplifying Freud without trivializing him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2109930.Introducing_Freud

The graphic novel depicts Wojnarowicz's childhood of prostitution and drugs on the streets of Manhattan, through his adulthood living with AIDS, and his anger at the indifference of government and health agencies. Originally published as a comic book in 1996 by DC's Vertigo Comics, an imprint best-known for horror and fantasy material such as The Sandman, 7 Miles a Secondwas an instant critical success, but struggled to find an audience amongst the typical Vertigo readership. It has become a cult classic amongst fans of literary and art comics, just as Wojnarowicz's influence and reputation have widened in the larger art world. Romberger and Van Cook's visuals give stunning life to Wojnarowicz's words, blending the gritty naturalism of Lower East Side street life with a hallucinatory, psychedelic imagination that takes perfect advantage of the comics medium. This new edition will finally present the artwork as it was intended: oversized, and with Van Cook's elegant watercolors restored.

As seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl named Una, it takes place in northern England in 1977, as the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer of prostitutes, is on the loose and creating panic among the townspeople. As the police struggle in their clumsy attempts to find the killer, and the headlines in the local paper become more urgent, a once self-confident Una teaches herself to ""lower her gaze"" in order to deflect attention from boys.
After she is ""slut-shamed"" at school for having birth control pills, Una herself is the subject of violent acts for which she comes to blame herself. But as the police finally catch up and identify the killer, Una grapples with the patterns of behavior that led her to believe she was to blame.
Becoming Unbecoming combines various styles, press clippings, photo-based illustrations, and splashes of color to convey Una's sense of confusion and rage, as well as sobering statistics on sexual violence against women. The book is a no-holds-barred indictment of sexual violence against women and the shame and blame of its victims that also celebrates the empowerment of those able to gain control over their selves and their bodies.

""An estimated 19,000 rapes and sexual assaults took place in the military last year. Every one of them represents a monstrous crime made much worse by the sense of betrayal that accompanied it. That so few victims--just one in seven--report these crimes underscores the utter lack of trust that pervades military culture.""
-- Retired Gen. Loree Sutton and Garry Trudeau, in a Washington PostOpEd, June 29, 2013
The first time B.D. encounters command-rape survivor Melissa Wheeler in the waiting room at the VA Center, he has no idea what to make of the scowling former chopper mechanic. But in the months that follow, witnessing Mel's pain and her healing process help him with his own, and B.D. ends up a staunch and encouraging ally.
With the help of VA counselors Cora and Elias, Wheeler is able to reframe her experience and move forward to the point where she re-ups and re-deploys, though the trauma and betrayal continue to haunt her. She and battlebud Roz masterfully manage a perilous rescue op of a downed USO chopper, and in the new post-DADT world the now-out Roz and her now-superior (""That's SERGEANT bitch to you!"") help wind down US ops in Afghanistan. Returning stateside, Mel's final obstacle is her father's cluelessness--and a widespread reluctance to hear the truth of her story.
As always, Trudeau manages to find humor and humanity in even a tale of suffering, and sheds serious light on one of the most pressing and undermining problems in our military today.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535693-mel-s-story

It was the greatly admired Winston Churchill, a depression sufferer for much of his life, who nicknamed this human condition ""Black Dog.""
Living with a Black Dogis perhaps the most useful book ever created about depression. In simple text and strongly supportive illustrations, this slim volume examines, explains, and demystifies one of the most widespread and debilitating problems afflicting modern society.
Whether you've struggled with your own Black Dog for years, wondered why you're feeling sort of ""ruff"" lately, or known someone shadowed by a dark canine, Living with a Black Dogis for you. Artist and writer Matthew Johnstone, a depression sufferer himself, delivers a moving and uplifting insight into life with this unsavory companion. Even better, the book shows the strength and support to be found within and around us to tame this shaggy beast and ultimately bring it to heel.
Johnstone's book doesn't pretend to have all the answers. It doesn't resort to simple ""dog tricks"" for dealing with depression. But Living with a Black Dogdoes deliver understanding, hope, and the assurance that Black Dog days are not forever.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96202.Living_with_a_Black_Dog

So begins the wrenching diary of Minnie Goetze, a fifteen-year-old girl longing for love and acceptance and struggling with her own precocious sexuality. After losing her virginity to her mother's boyfriend, Minnie pursues a string of sexual encounters (with both boys and girls) while experimenting with drugs and developing her talents as an artist. Unsupervised and unguided by her aloof and narcissistic mother, Minnie plunges into a defenseless, yet fearless adolescence.
While set in the libertine atmosphere of 1970s San Francisco, Minnie's journey to understand herself and her world is universal: this is the story of a young woman troubled by the discontinuity between what she thinks and feels and what she observes in those around her. Acclaimed cartoonist and author Phoebe Gloeckner serves up a deft blend of visual and verbal narrative in her complex presentation of a pivotal year in a girl's life, recounted in diary pages and illustrations, with full narrative sequences in comics form. The Diary of a Teenage Girloffers a searing comment on adult society as seen though the eyes of a young woman on the verge of joining it.
This edition has been updated by the author with an introduction reflecting on the book's critical reception and value as diary or novel, historical document or work of art. Also included in this revised edition are supplementary photographs and illustrations from the author's childhood, including some of her own diary entries.

Everything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.
Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched.

The book opens in America, where the boy's father works for the South Vietnam embassy; there the boy is made to feel self-conscious about his otherness thanks to schoolmates who play war games against the so-called ""Commies."" The family is called back to Saigon in 1961, where the father becomes Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem's personal interpreter; as the growing conflict between North and South intensifies, so does turmoil within Marco's family, as his mother struggles to grapple with bipolar disorder.
Visually powerful and emotionally potent, Such a Lovely Little War is both a large-scale and intimate study of the Vietnam war as seen through the eyes of the Vietnamese: a turbulent national history interwined with an equally traumatic familial one.
Marcelino Truong is an illustrator, painter, and author. Born the son of a Vietnamese diplomat in 1957 in the Philippines, he and his family moved to America (where his father worked for the embassy) and then to Vietnam at the outset of the war.

Everything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.
Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.
We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched. The zany art and probing text do an extraordinary job of simplifying Freud without trivializing him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1464021.Freud_para_principiantes

trauma,Kaspar,Diane Obomsawin,,"A sad and cautionary tale of mystery, fame, murder, and innocence
May 28, 1828, marked the beginning of the official life of Kaspar Hauser, a young man who appeared mysteriously in the streets of Nuremberg and died of knife wounds five years later under equally mysterious circumstances. ""Europe's child,"" as pamphleteers referred to him, captured the imagination of salon society. Allegedly raised in a dark cellar and deprived of human contact until the age of sixteen, he became the proof of a concept for theories about natural man, original sin, and the civilizing mission of culture. Rightful heir to the throne of Baden or a fraud? Redeemer of man's sins or ""ambulatory automatist""? The curious circumstances and significance of his life have been disputed ever since.
In Kaspar, Quebec cartoonist Diane Obomsawin draws on Hauser's own writings, and contemporary accounts, to tell the foundling's strange story. Minimalist grayscale panels and the simplest of line work register the wonder and bewilderment of a trusting and sensitive soul emerging into a fickle society. Gentle and poetic, naive and profound, Obomsawin's first book to appear in English translation has a quiet and compelling charm.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6217804-kaspar

Yozo Oba is a troubled soul incapable of revealing his true self to others. A weak constitution and the lingering trauma from some abuse administered by a relative forces him to uphold a facade of hollow jocularity since high school. The series is composed of three parts, referred to in the novel as ""memorandums,"" which chronicle the life of Oba from his teens to late twenties. The comic is narrated by the artist, Furuya himself playing the role originally held by the author Dazai, who makes appearances at the start of each volume. In many ways, it could be said that Furuya has traveled a path that may be similar to Dazai's. Maybe that is what led these two together after 100 years.
In the second volume, comic artist Usamaru Furuya has become obsessed over Oba's behavior. Noticing how tormented this young man must have been, he begins to question whether he should continue reading these memoirs. He fears he may see his own future going down the same path. But, despite his fears he reads on now smitten with Oba and the cast of fre-nemies around him.
Oba's Second Memorandum focuses on his college days. Increasingly paranoid about keeping up appearances he begins to neglect his studies and his ambitions of becoming an artist are now a thing of the past. He is spending money left and right. And soon finds himself in a destructive cycle of drinking and self-loathing. Spurred on by a fellow aspiring artist, he begins to take advantage of his family spending money like water to maintain his bad habits.
So when the money well dries up, he tries to escape life entirely; fearing that his family and in turn the world has abandoned him. But his charms continue to linger. From here he begins to take advantage of his unique personality to live off the one-sided love of the women around him. Whether it be the experienced bar owner or the or the single-parent comics editor, Oba's heart never truly opens up but if these women give him another chance on life, he is willing to take it as long as their own personal expectations do not overwhelm him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10887432-no-longer-human-vol-2

Furuya's adaptation of No Longer Human takes place nearly seventy years after Dazai's original. Set in modern day Tokyo, Dazai's tale details the life of a young man originally from a well-off family from Japan's far north. Yozo Oba is a troubled soul incapable of revealing his true self to others. A weak constitution and the lingering trauma from some abuse administered by a relative forces him to uphold a facade of hollow jocularity since high school. The series is composed of three parts, referred to in the novel as ""memorandums,"" which chronicle the life of Oba from his teens to late twenties. The comic is narrated by the artist, Furuya himself, making appearances at the start of each volume. In many ways, it could be said that Furuya has traveled a path that may be similar to Dazai's. Maybe that is what led these two together after 100 years.
In this first of three parts, alternative comic artist Usamaru Furuya appears to be overcome with deadlines. While he has been published by some of the biggest names in the comics industry, his star still shines brightest as a cult favorite, an underground artist whose emo comics are the voice of a new generation. To escape the duldrums of work, he loses himself in the internet and comes across the journal of a man whose life sounds very familiar--Oba Yozo. In Oba's First Memorandum the teen is overcome by an intense feeling of alienation. This pressure is so strong he cannot cope with others making it impossible to socialize with those who surround him, even his own family. To counter this Oba plays the role of the fool in order to establish interpersonal

With this strong entry in the autobiographical comic genre, Roberts is unafraid to show herself looking bad, such as when she's frustrated when her daughter, Xia, calls her-only to find out it's to say ""I love you."" In the comic's best pages, Roberts and Xia struggle with toilet training (""That already happened,"" Xia beams when she is warned to keep her butt out of the bowl), and Xia abuses her swearing privileges. The linework on the characters is detailed while retaining a sketchiness for backgrounds that makes the figures feel raw, rather than polished. The simple, direct art makes for an intimate, personal journey through Roberts's life as a mother and creator."" Alex Hoffman, Sequential State, 5 June, 2015 - ""Roberts' comics primarily explore her relationship with her daughter Xia and husband Scott, as well as her interactions with friends and extended family. These are classic slice-of-life comics, and Roberts uses sometimes panels, sometimes full pages to capture the essence of certain moments. Xia is growing up and learning about the world around her, and the strange internal logic of toddlers gives Miseryland much of its charm. Slice-of-life comics can often be cute or endearing, but Miseryland is funny, laugh out loud funny, mostly due to the inanities and bad behaviors of its youngest cast member and Roberts' deadpan reactions. Importantly, Roberts isn't writing a ""kids say the darndest things"" comic; as panels and pages fall into place throughout Miseryland, these small stories paint a picture of Roberts as a melancholy, anxious mother living with bipolar disorder and trying to find the best way to raise her daughter. Xia is oftentimes the access point to these feelings, pointing out the hidden in ways that make it seem obvious. Miseryland isn't a tell all, either - even when things like Roberts miscarriage come up, the stories told are more a remembering than an exposure. We find Roberts at high and low points throughout the book, and while these moments coalesce into a larger vision, Miseryland has time to explore the way creative processes and personal time are changed after you have children. Some of these comics are certainly a part of the book because Xia wasn't napping when Roberts was drawing, just as some are there to illustrate Roberts fears and frustrations."" printed with the assistance of Koyama Press",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25304516-miseryland

disorder,"Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo, and Me",Ellen Forney,mental disorder,"Cartoonist Ellen Forney explores the relationship between ""crazy"" and ""creative"" in this graphic memoir of her bipolar disorder, woven with stories of famous bipolar artists and writers.
Shortly before her thirtieth birthday, Forney was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Flagrantly manic and terrified that medications would cause her to lose creativity, she began a years-long struggle to find mental stability while retaining her passions and creativity.
Searching to make sense of the popular concept of the crazy artist, she finds inspiration from the lives and work of other artists and writers who suffered from mood disorders, including Vincent van Gogh, Georgia O'Keeffe, William Styron, and Sylvia Plath. She also researches the clinical aspects of bipolar disorder, including the strengths and limitations of various treatments and medications, and what studies tell us about the conundrum of attempting to ""cure"" an otherwise brilliant mind.
Darkly funny and intensely personal, Forney's memoir provides a visceral glimpse into the effects of a mood disorder on an artist's work, as she shares her own story through bold black-and-white images and evocative prose.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542990-marbles

In one terrifying moment, civilization crumbled. An outbreak of insanity swept across the planet, turning millions of people into the scarred homicidal maniacs known as ""the Crossed."" For one small band of survivors, the discovery of a starving, injured man in the desert seems like an unexpected blessing. He knows where they could be safe: the location of the last holdout of the scientific community, where the military offers protection and the cure to the Crossed plague is being developed. But Harold Lorre is not the savior they hope him to be. He's a calculating, lethal man whose mind was dangerously unhinged even before the world went mad. Surrounded by marauding hordes, their nerves shattered by unending fear, the group fall victim to the manipulations and deadly perversions of a psychopath.

As the go-to team tasked with handling the world's most top secret threats, the Suicide Squad has faced down terrors across the globe. But they've never brought their work home with them-until now.
Under the command of Task Force X's iron-fisted director Amanda Waller, the Squad has ""liberated"" a strange extradimensional orb known as the Black Vault from the planet's most secure incarceration facility-at the cost of one disintegrated team member. What's inside the eerie black sphere? None other than Kryptonian dictator General Zod, in all his megalomaniacal, world-destroying glory.
Now Waller has to figure out what to do with one of the most dangerous entities in the known universe. In theory, whoever controls Zod controls the world. In practice, the Black Vault's corrupting energies are already eroding the sanity of everyone in the Squad's HQ-with the sole exception of the Clown Princess of Crazy herself, Harley Quinn!
But can one newly sane psychologist single-handedly stop the madness of the Black Vault, defeat Zod and keep the Suicide Squad from ultimately living up to its name?

In this dark rendition, a greedy Geppetto builds Pinocchio as a metallic weapon of war, while Jiminy Cockroach is a homeless squatter living the good life in Pinocchio's skull. Critically acclaimed, Pinocchio won the Grand Prize at France's Angouleme comics festival in 2009. Exquisite drawings by celebrated cartoonist Winshluss bring to life a rich tale of greedy fools, lust, sadness, redemption, and hope. Teamed with brilliant colorist Cizo, Winshluss creates an epic adventure through a lush world. As we follow Pinocchio along the way, the stories and vinettes intertwine, offering subtle political critiques and send ups of popular culture. We meet seven sleazy dwarves, follow Jiminy's struggles as a novelist, watch a blind tramp find God, and see the innocent, yet powerful Pinocchio encircled by those who would use him for their own ends. Winshluss has perfected the wordless comic. Each page is perfectly composed - not a panel is wasted. The artwork is primarily done in pen and ink, and watercolor but switches to paint for larger splash panels. The art also references a terrific range of illustrative styles and history in the story from late 18th century pen and ink, to early French film pioneer Georges Melies, through early Disney, and underground comix. Born in 1970, Winshluss is the creator of numerous comics and graphic novels that have garnered awards and acclaim across Europe. Winshluss is the pen name of Vincent Parronnaud, perhaps best known as co-director of the animated film Persepolis (with Marjane Satrapi), which won the Jury Prize at Cannes and was nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award, Golden Globe and Cannes' Palm d'Or.

I, the author of this book (D.Shrigley BA (Hons)) shall take the reader on a journey around the human brain and along the way I shall point-out various things that are worthy of discussion. We will start our journey in the eye as that is a common entrance place to the brain. I shall ruminate about the eye and its properties. I shall tell how the eye's seeing is sorted-out in the brain and the magical nature of it and I shall warn of all the things that can go wrong in this sorting-out process. After the eye, we shall travel to the ear and discuss the world that is heard and how it is heard in the brain and all the awful things that can go wrong; some of them amusing and some not amusing. Taste and smell will of course be covered as these are also things of interest to the brain. We will also touch upon touch, so to speak. We will also touch upon the scalp, but only lightly and briefly. Once we have looked at the brain's government of the senses we shall start to talk about the really interesting stuff. Like how the brain decides what is right and wrong and why some people are very charming and others behave like monkeys. Some other questions that might be dealt-with are as follows: Could my brain be removed and replaced with a computer? Why can't I remember my wife's name?

The school is a hotbed of bullying and rape kept slightly in check by a feudal organization called the Salon. The Salon protects its members from random abuse by specifying who can/must rape whom (yeah, there are must rapes here) under what circumstances, and punishing those who rape/abuse without proper permission. All this to be decided at the whim of the Salon head.
Sex at the school is both an overwhelming obsession, as befits an all-male society where there are no other outlets for stress, and a matter of down-and-dirty power politics, not unlike an American jail.
When you throw in the Byzantine institution of the Salon, you have a scenario reminiscent of the surrealistic, closed, hothouse world of British boys' schools. But the Rika world is even more bizarre than that.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2209736._Shiiku_Gakari_Rika_1_

Born in Alabama in 1900, she was only 18 when she met F. Scott Fitzgerald, an ambitious young writer who would turn into one the greatest American authors of all time. Beautiful, talented, irreverent, extravagant, and alcohol-driven, the newly married couple took New York's high society and the whole literary world by storm. They traveled to France, Italy, and Africa; hung out with Ernest Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, and Gertrude Stein; managed to both charm and enrage most of the people they were acquainted with; and ended up destroying their love and themselves-Zelda was diagnosed with schizophrenia and spent more than a decade in psychiatric clinics, tragically dying at 48 in a fire. Superzelda is a thoroughly researched work based on period photographs and documents, as well as on Zelda and Scott's writing. It is a biography, a love story, and a travelogue all wrapped into one.

Critically acclaimed, Pinocchio won the Grand Prize at France's Angouleme comics festival in 2009. Exquisite drawings by celebrated cartoonist Winshluss bring to life a rich tale of greedy fools, lust, sadness, redemption, and hope. Teamed with brilliant colorist Cizo, Winshluss creates an epic adventure through a lush world. As we follow Pinocchio along the way, the stories and vinettes intertwine, offering subtle political critiques and send ups of popular culture. We meet seven sleazy dwarves, follow Jiminy's struggles as a novelist, watch a blind tramp find God, and see the innocent, yet powerful Pinocchio encircled by those who would use him for their own ends. Winshluss has perfected the wordless comic. Each page is perfectly composed - not a panel is wasted. The artwork is primarily done in pen and ink, and watercolor but switches to paint for larger splash panels. The art also references a terrific range of illustrative styles and history in the story from late 18th century pen and ink, to early French film pioneer Georges Melies, through early Disney, and underground comix. Born in 1970, Winshluss is the creator of numerous comics and graphic novels that have garnered awards and acclaim across Europe.

Killed in action. That's the official story on the Suicide Squad, the crack team of the world's most dangerous super-villains assembled to do the jobs too dirty for the good guys to handle. Also known as Task Force X, they've been X'ed out, leaving their minder and master, Amanda Waller, behind to pick up the pieces.
At least that's what they want you to believe.
Thanks to Harley Quinn's secret contact on the outside, the Squad has faked their deaths, leaving Harley, Deadshot, Cheetah and Diablo free to live life on their own terms...or so it seems. But by escaping both Waller and the walls of Belle Reve Prison, they may have dug their own graves. They've fallen into the clutches of the Fist of Cain, the insane death cult that helped them play dead--and who are now trying to make their ruse a reality!
To survive, the Suicide Squad must turn to their one-time captors--and Deadshot's hated rival, Captain Boomerang--for help, or they'll finally live up to their name...

suicide,The Attack Graphic Novel,Loic Dauvillier Glen Chapron Yasmina Khadra,suicide,"""The Attack"" opens with Amin Jaafari, an Israeli surgeon of Palestinian origin, trying to save the casualties of a suicide bombing. A day after the deadly attack, an Israeli police officer informs Jaafari that the suicide bomber was his wife, Sihem. Believing her to be on an overnight trip, he completely refuses to accept the accusation. They were leading an ideal life in Tel Aviv, moving among both Arab and Israeli society with ease, or so Jaafari thought. But then he receives a posthumous message from Sihem confirming the worst. Desperate to understand how he missed even the slightest clue, Jaafari leaves the relative security of Israel and enters the Palestinian territories to find the fanatics who recruited her. In search of the truth, he confronts a reality that he had refused to see.
This book was first published as the French novel ""L'Attentat"" by Yasmina Khadra in 2005. One year later, ""L'Attentat"" was translated into English as ""The Attack"" and it garnered international praise: ""A fierce rendering of geopolitical tensions and a plea for peace"" (""The New York Times""); ""Audaciously conceived, courageously important [and] urgently humane"" (""The Los Angeles Times""). It was translated into more than 20 languages and sold over 600,000 copies.
Then in 2012, the original French book went into graphic form with the release in 2012 of ""L'Attentat"" by Loic Dauvillier and Glen Chaprion. This has now been translated into English by Ivanka Hahnenberger -- the book featured here.
""The Attack"" is a poignant tragedy that mixes the intimacy of grief and betrayal with the futility of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It makes no judgment and takes no side. Chapron's masterful illustrations and astute text are wrought with the despair and hope of Jaafari's search. The raw humanity of the story raises more questions than can be answered.

It secured the cartoonist's place as one of his generation's most skillful and ambitious practitioners, and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family.
Mother, Come Homequietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Thomas, protected by a lion's mask that his mother gave him, constructs an identity for himself as ""the groundskeeper"": ritual and routine, already important to children that age, become paramount to him. He struggles desperately to keep up appearances while his father, a professor of symbolic logic, becomes lost in abstractions. Father and son begin to retreat into their fantasies, but only one emerges.
Mother, Come Homeis masterfully drawn: Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier's controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David's inexorable descent into utter despair. Hornschemeier is equally precise when it comes to Mother, Come Home's color palette: subdued but warm, which suits the story's melancholy and contemplative mode.

suicide,Pinocchio,Winshluss,,"This award-winning graphic novel re-imagines the story Pinocchio as a noir fairy tale both comic and tragic. In this dark rendition, a greedy Geppetto builds Pinocchio as a metallic weapon of war, while Jiminy Cockroach is a homeless squatter living the good life in Pinocchio's skull. Critically acclaimed, Pinocchio won the Grand Prize at France's Angouleme comics festival in 2009. Exquisite drawings by celebrated cartoonist Winshluss bring to life a rich tale of greedy fools, lust, sadness, redemption, and hope. Teamed with brilliant colorist Cizo, Winshluss creates an epic adventure through a lush world. As we follow Pinocchio along the way, the stories and vinettes intertwine, offering subtle political critiques and send ups of popular culture. We meet seven sleazy dwarves, follow Jiminy's struggles as a novelist, watch a blind tramp find God, and see the innocent, yet powerful Pinocchio encircled by those who would use him for their own ends. Winshluss has perfected the wordless comic. Each page is perfectly composed - not a panel is wasted. The artwork is primarily done in pen and ink, and watercolor but switches to paint for larger splash panels. The art also references a terrific range of illustrative styles and history in the story from late 18th century pen and ink, to early French film pioneer Georges Melies, through early Disney, and underground comix. Born in 1970, Winshluss is the creator of numerous comics and graphic novels that have garnered awards and acclaim across Europe. Winshluss is the pen name of Vincent Parronnaud, perhaps best known as co-director of the animated film Persepolis (with Marjane Satrapi), which won the Jury Prize at Cannes and was nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award, Golden Globe and Cannes' Palm d'Or.

suicide,Psychiatric Tales,Darryl Cunningham,illness mental health,"Psychiatric Talesdraws on Darryl Cunningham's time working in a psychiatric ward to give a reasoned and sympathetic look into the world of mental illness. In each chapter, Cunningham explores a different mental health problem, using evocative imagery to describe the experience of mental illness, both from the point of view of those beset by illness and their friends and relatives. As Cunningham reveals this human experience, he also shows how society's perceptions of and reactions to mental illness perpetuate needless stigma, for example, the myth that schizophrenic people are more likely to commit crimes than non-schizophrenic people. Psychiatric Talesis a groundbreaking graphic work; it deftly demythologizes and destigmatizes the disorders that 26.2 percent of American adults live with every day.
Concluding with a reflection on how mental illness has affected his own life, Darryl Cunningham's Psychiatric Talesis a moving, engaging examination of what is, at its root, the human condition.

illness,Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?,Roz Chast,,"In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22015649-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.
A work of great bravery and humanity, Stitchesis a gripping and ultimately redemptive story of a man's struggle to understand the past and reclaim his voice.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6707734-stitches

illness,Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?: A Memoir,Roz Chast,,"In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28260562-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

Jinchalo is Korean for ""Really?"" and that question (formulated variously as ""What is and what isn't?"" ""What is real?"" and ""What is imagined?"") is at the heart of this book. A companion to Matthew Forsythe's vastly successful Ojingogo, Jinchalo stars the same little girl as its heroine. When the mischievous shape-shifter Jinchalo hatches from a mysterious egg, he starts our heroine adventuring anew. Magical troubles drag the pair out of the safety of her home, through the small village where she resides, up, up, and away. In the course of their flight, they visit a robot garden, follow a vine into the clouds, and leave the village far behind.
These comics are firmly rooted in Korean folktales and stylistic conventions, with a playful, joyous drawn line. Jinchalo welcomes readers back into Forsythe's Miyazaki-tinged dreamscape where spotted octopi fly and bears give piggyback rides, where hummingbirds are larger than people and a sad furry monster wearing a bowler hat lurks around every corner.

Picking up a harmonica and eventually a battered guitar, Guthrie finds solace in the ancient lineage of folksong. Hayes charts the musician's course from Oklahoma and Texas towns ravaged by dust and the Depression to boxcars, factory farms, and the migrant camps of California, highlighting Guthrie's dedication to singing American folk tunes and creating his own modern classics along the way. Hayes ends his portrait in 1940, at the pivotal time when Guthrie makes his way to New York and writes ""This Land Is Your Land,"" his iconic anthem tinged with both clear-eyed reality and optimism.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26240662-woody-guthrie-and-the-dust-bowl-ballads

illness,Unforgotten,Tohby Riddle,,"This striking, evocative book is a testament to Tohby Riddle's skill, dedication and commitment to making a strong statement that he believes in. It's a book about light and dark, doubt and faith, friendship and compassion.
Riddle's representations of the strangeness of the urban landscape evoke a sense of movement that has been captured - and stilled momentarily - as if by the lens of an old-fashioned camera. Whenever we spend time with it, the spare text and mesmerising images have a way of calming the room around us as if there is
something peaceful settling over us as we read. It is a triumph of wonderful quiet beauty.
Unforgotten feels like a classic in the making with its thought-provoking edgy surrealism, plea for compassion and sense of the absurd, while leaving lots of room for individual, imaginative interpretation.
""Reading this book is like being quietly ushered into another dimension by winged strangers, a place beyond the tread of normal earth-bound language. Ephemeral as a feather, timeless as a rock, and as true as both, Unforgotten is a magical experience.""

illness,Black Is the Color,Julia Gfrorer,,"Black Is the Colorbegins with a 17th-century sailor abandoned at sea by his shipmates, and as it progresses he endures, and eventually succumbs to, both his lingering death sentence and the advances of a cruel and amorous mermaid. The narrative also explores the experiences of the loved ones he leaves behind, on his ship and at home on land, as well as of the mermaids who jadedly witness his destruction. At the heart of the story lie the dubious value of maintaining dignity to the detriment of intimacy, and the erotic potential of the worst-case scenario. Julie Gfrorer's delicate drawing style perfectly complements the period era of Black Is the Color, bringing the lyricism and romanticism of Gfrorer's prose to the fore.

illness,Stitches,David Small,cancer,"One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6407014-stitches

The graphic novel depicts Wojnarowicz's childhood of prostitution and drugs on the streets of Manhattan, through his adulthood living with AIDS, and his anger at the indifference of government and health agencies. Originally published as a comic book in 1996 by DC's Vertigo Comics, an imprint best-known for horror and fantasy material such as The Sandman, 7 Miles a Secondwas an instant critical success, but struggled to find an audience amongst the typical Vertigo readership. It has become a cult classic amongst fans of literary and art comics, just as Wojnarowicz's influence and reputation have widened in the larger art world. Romberger and Van Cook's visuals give stunning life to Wojnarowicz's words, blending the gritty naturalism of Lower East Side street life with a hallucinatory, psychedelic imagination that takes perfect advantage of the comics medium.

illness,Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?,Roz Chast,,"#1 New York TimesBestseller
2014 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST
In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594409-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

She's been called an inimitable and masterful stylist, a kind of Edward Gorey who draws out the whimsical side of body-horror, and indeed, the spirit of Gorey's grotesques breathes through French's creations. In H Day, her first graphic novel in four years, French explores, through metaphor and in pictures, her struggles with migraine headaches, marshaling troops of insects, beasts and humanoids to envision the processes that result in such hideous sensations. A sweeping, often tense narrative of invasion, repulsion and liberation, H Daycan be read both as an oblique autobiography and as a suspenseful fantasy story.

Glamorous, superconnected Ann Tenna is the founder of Eyemauler, a New York City-based Web site that's always the first to dish the most up-to-the-minute dirt on celebrities and ordinary folks alike. Ann has ascended to the zenith of the New York media scene, attended by groups of grovelers all too willing to be trampled on by her six-inch Giuseppe Zanottis if it means better seats at the table.
But as high as her success has taken her, Ann has actually fallen far--very far--from her true self. It takes a near-fatal freak accident on her birthday--April Fool's Day--and an intervention from her cosmic double in a realm beyond our own to make Ann realize the full cost of the humanity she has lost.

That/s the question that sets this powerful, funny, and poignant graphic memoir in motion. In vivid color and with a taboo-breaking sense of humor, Marisa Acocella Marchetto tells the story of her eleven-month, ultimately triumphant bout with breast cancer--from diagnosis to cure, and every challenging step in between.
But Cancer Vixenis about more than surviving an illness. It is a portrait of one woman's supercharged life in Manhattan, and a wonderful love story. Marisa, self-described ""terminal bachelorette"", meets her Prince Charming in Silvano, owner of the chic downtown restaurant Da Silvano. Three weeks before their wedding, she receives her diagnosis. She wonders: How will he react to this news? How will my world change? Will I even survive? And... what about my hair?

illness,My Degeneration: A Journey Through Parkinson's,Peter Dunlap-Shohl,mental depression,"How does one deal with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at the age of forty-three? My Degeneration, by former Anchorage Daily Newsstaff cartoonist Peter Dunlap-Shohl, answers the question with humor and passion, recounting the author's attempt to come to grips with the ""malicious whimsy"" of this chronic, progressive, and disabling disease. This graphic novel tracks Dunlap-Shohl's journey through depression, the worsening symptoms of the disease, the juggling of medications and their side effects, the impact on relations with family and community, and the raft of mental and physical changes wrought by the malady.
My Degenerationexamines the current state of Parkinson's care, including doctor/patient relations and the repercussions of a disease that, among other things, impairs movement, can rob patients of their ability to speak or write, degrades sufferers' ability to deal with complexity, and interferes with the sense of balance. Readers learn what it's like to undergo a dramatic, demanding, and audacious bit of high-tech brain surgery that can mysteriously restore much of a patient's control over symptoms. But My Degenerationis more than a Parkinson's memoir. Dunlap-Shohl gives the person newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease the information necessary to cope with it on a day-to-day basis. He chronicles the changes that life with the disease can bring to the way one sees the world and the way one is seen by the wider community. Dunlap-Shohl imparts a realistic basis for hope--hope not only to carry on, but to enjoy a decent quality of life.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26401604-my-degeneration

illness,Heart Transplant,Andrew Vachss Frank Caruso Zak Mucha,suicide,"School bullying is universally decried, bemoaned, and condemned. Newspapers, magazines, television, and movies all reflect the ugly truth ... bullying is not only on the rise, but becoming more dangerous every day. Whether it's a teenager committing suicide as a result of a Facebook posting or a group of schoolchildren taunting another autistic child and filming it for the ""entertainment"" of others, the longest-lasting, deepest-scarring impact of bullying is emotional, not physical. Failure to understand this has handicapped an already-insipid series of failed ""solutions.""
Heart Transplant is aimed at actually *changing* the way we deal with perhaps the most critical issue for children and parents alike today. To accomplish this mission, an entirely new medium was created. Neither a graphic novel nor a self-help book, it uses elements of both to deconstruct bullying, and to offer both teens and their parents the true ""facts of life.""
Nine-year-old Sean's only experience with parenting was the series of men his alcoholic mother made him call ""Daddy."" He knows he doesn't belong ... anywhere. And never will. He sees himself as others see him: Outsider.
When Sean comes home from school one day, he opens the door to a pair of corpses -- his latest ""father's"" attempt at dope-dealing ended badly. The police arrive, the bodies are bagged, and the ""Welfare lady"" is telling Sean how much he's going to love his new foster home when an older man suddenly crosses the threshold. He tells the social worker that he's the father of the dead man, so that makes him responsible for his ""grandson."" And he offers Sean a choice: come and live with him, or take his chances with foster care.
Life with the man Sean comes to call ""Pop"" is Paradise compared to the past. A brilliant and hardworking student, Sean finally has someone to show his report card to ... and he listens to Pop harder than he ever did to a teacher. Still an Outsider, yes, but now there's one place on earth where he knows he's always welcome. And always safe.
But puberty brings Sean into a new world; a world where he is bullied every day ... a world where his status as ""Outsider"" is confirmed in endlessly cruel ways. He never complains, but Pop quickly discovers the truth. When Sean protests that ""It didn't hurt."" his realfather responds that he knows that's a lie ... because when his son is hurt, he hurts, too. This is Sean's first experience with empathy, and his first understanding of emotional abuse.
His understanding of bullying comes later ... when Pop shows him not only its true roots, but its antidote. Pop gives his son what he needs most: A heart transplant. It is not until after Pop's death that Sean learns the special sacrifice his father had made to give him that transplant, and that final understanding is Sean's ultimate legacy.
Timely and confrontational, HEART TRANSPLANT is the gripping story of young boy's transformation from bullied ""outsider"" to true manhood. The universality of this work is such that what Sean learns is communicated to bullied children and their parent(s) alike. It speaks with a truth that cannot be denied, but also with a response that canbe replicated.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8581764-heart-transplant

illness,Last Things: A Graphic Memoir of Loss and Love,Marissa Moss,illness,"Last Thingsis the true and intensely personal story of how one woman coped with the devastating effects of a catastrophic illness in her family.
Using her trademark mix of words and pictures to sharp effect, Marissa Moss presents the story of how she, her husband, and her three young sons struggled to maintain their sense of selves and wholeness as a family and how they continued on with everyday life when the earth shifted beneath their feet.
After returning home from a year abroad, Marissa's husband, Harvey, was diagnosed with ALS. The disease progressed quickly, and Marissa was soon consumed with caring for Harvey while trying to keep life as normal as possible for her young children. ALS stole the man who was her husband, the father of her children, and her best friend in less than 7 months.
This is not a story about the redemptive power of a terminal illness. It is a story of resilience--of how a family managed to survive a terrible loss and grow in spite of it. Although it's a sad story, it's powerfully told and ultimately uplifting as a guide to strength and perseverance, to staying connected to those who matter most in the midst of a bleak upheaval. If you've ever wondered how you would cope with a dire diagnosis, this book can provide a powerful example of what it feels like and how to come through the darkness into the light.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32445058-last-things

illness,Vincent,Barbara Stok Camila Werner,,"Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) e sua mente torturada conceberam uma arte fascinante que transcendeu sua propria historia para se tornar um dos mais expressivos e maravilhosos conjuntos de pinturas jamais concebidos. Nesta graphic novel de tracos pop originalissimos, Barbara Stok retrata de forma delicada e luminosa os ultimos anos da vida do pintor holandes, passados na Franca, onde encontrou nao apenas seu fim, mas tambem a natureza e a luz que imortalizou em seus quadros.
Em 1888, apos uma estadia de dois anos em Paris, Vincent van Gogh muda-se para Arles, no sul da Franca. A luminosidade, os espacos abertos e as paisagens bucolicas da regiao, alem do proprio contato com a natureza, fornecem ao artista a materia-prima para aquela que e considerada a fase mais rica e revolucionaria de sua arte.
Se por um lado o ambiente o enche de contentamento e esperanca, por outro agravam-se seu desequilibrio e sua angustia, piorados ainda pela falta de dinheiro e de perspectivas concretas de futuro e pela culpa de ser um fardo para o irmao, Theo, que o sustentava financeiramente.
E esse turbulento e rico periodo, nao apenas crucial para a compreensao do genio Van Gogh como tambem emblematico de sua existencia, que a artista grafica Barbara Stok retrata, com um colorido e uma singeleza dignos do genio holandes. Barbara pinta com todas as cores um Vincent humano, com suas ambiguidades e fraquezas. Incorporando sabiamente trechos de cartas escritas ao irmao Theo e telas do proprio pintor, aborda seu processo criativo, suas ideias sobre pintura e a obcecada conviccao em sua propria arte, que sempre o guiou. O resultado e um personagem cativante, repleto de nuances, e que emociona por sua arte e tambem pela pureza da paixao com que a perseguia.
Barbara Stok nasceu em 1970 em Groningen, na Holanda. Trabalhou como fotografa e jornalista ate estrear, em 1998, com o livro de tiras Barbaraal tot op het bot, no qual retratava o proprio cotidiano. Seu traco original, sua narrativa delicada e sua maneira de ampliar pequenos detalhes da existencia fizeram sucesso.

Riddle's representations of the strangeness of the urban landscape evoke a sense of movement that has been captured - and stilled momentarily - as if by the lens of an old-fashioned camera. Whenever we spend time with it, the spare text and mesmerising images have a way of calming the room around us as if there is
something peaceful settling over us as we read. It is a triumph of wonderful quiet beauty.
Unforgotten feels like a classic in the making with its thought-provoking edgy surrealism, plea for compassion and sense of the absurd, while leaving lots of room for individual, imaginative interpretation.
""Reading this book is like being quietly ushered into another dimension by winged strangers, a place beyond the tread of normal earth-bound language. Ephemeral as a feather, timeless as a rock, and as true as both, Unforgotten is a magical experience.""

illness,Stitches: A Memoir,David Small,cancer,"Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award and finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards: the prize-winning children's author depicts a childhood from hell in this searing yet redemptive graphic memoir.
One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statement.
A silent movie masquerading as a book, Stitches renders a broken world suddenly seamless and beautiful again. Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award (Young Adult); finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards (Best Writer/Artist: Nonfiction; Best Reality-Based Work).",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13509102-stitches

There she meets widower Brian and is swept off her feet. Romantic and exuberant, with four loving children, Brian seems like everything a woman could possibly want, and Roz falls deeply in love.

illness,Not Your Mother's Meatloaf: A Sex Education Comic Book,Saiya  Miller Liza Bley,health,"As teenagers today navigate increasingly fluid identities and choices, there is a demand for an accessible, interactive tool to help share knowledge about sex and sexual health; one that demystifies the facts and speaks frankly about experiences whose lessons often fall into the grey areas.
Since 2008, Miller and Bley have held an open call for young people to create comics that address a variety of topics involved with sex education. We have since produced several issues of a sex-ed comic called Not Your Mother's Meatloaf. The work is chosen from a vastly varied group of submissions and attempts to challenge hetero and gender normative practices in sex education. The comics address topics like body image, safer sex, consent, and relationships, from positions that have historically been left out of sex education.
These graphically illustrated personal narratives address different themes, such as ""Firsts,"" ""Bodies,"" ""Health,"" ""Age,"" and ""Endings."" The book will bring together the best of the material from the Not Your Mother's Meatloafcomics, along with new graphic stories and writing by the editors providing personal and sociological background.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16129281-not-your-mother-s-meatloaf
illness,Uncomfortably Happily,Yeon-Sik Hong,depression,"Inspired by Yeon-sik Hong's attempt to move to the country with his partner, Uncomfortably, Happilyis the story of a young couple finding their way. Burdened by unmet comics deadlines and high rent, our narrator and his wife know they must make a change. Convinced the absence of traffic noise will ease his writer's block, our pair welcomes the idea of building a life from scratch. Deciding on a home atop an uninhabited mountain, they excitedly embrace the charms of their new rural existence.
From tending to the land and attempting grocery runs through snow, to the complexities of fighting depression in seclusion, the move does not immediately prove to be the golden ticket they'd hoped for, and the silence of the mountain poses as much of an obstacle to output as the sirens of the city. Through it all, though, we see simple pleasures seep in and gain prominence over these commercial, and, often, comparatively trivial worries: the smell of the forest, the calming weight of enveloping snow, and the gratification of a stripped down life making art begin to muffle other concerns.
Originally published in Korean to great acclaim and winning the Manhwa Today award, Uncomfortably, Happilyuniquely explores our narrator's inner world. Hong propels the comic with gorgeously detailed yet simple art, sharing the story of two lives unfolding slowly, sometimes uncomfortably, yet ultimately, happily.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29875903-uncomfortably-happily

A story from the comic strips that will make you laugh and cry
Tom Batiuk spent several years as a middle school art teacher before creating the comic strip Funky Winkerbeanin 1972. Originally a ""gag-a-day"" comic strip that portrayed life in high school, Funkyhas evolved into a mature series of real-life stories examining such social issues as teen dating abuse, teen pregnancy, teen suicide, violence in schools, the war in the Middle East, alcoholism, divorce, and cancer.
In 1999, Lisa Moore, one of Funky's friends and a main character, discovered she had breast cancer. Batiuk, unsure about dealing with such a serious subject on the funny pages, decided to go ahead with the story line. He approached the topic with the idea that mixing humor with serious and real themes heightens the reader's interest. Lisa and husband Les faced the same physical, psychological, and social issues as anyone else dealing with the disease.
After a mastectomy and chemotherapy, Lisa was cancer free. She finished her law degree, opened a practice, and had a baby daughter, Summer. Then, in the spring of 2006, the cancer returned and metastasized. Lisa's Story: The Other Shoeis a collection of both the 1999 comic strips on Lisa's initial battle with cancer and the current series examining her struggle with the disease and its outcome. Additionally, it contains resource material on breast cancer, including early detection, information sources, support systems, and health care.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1721886.Lisa_s_Story

illness,¿Podemos hablar de algo más agradable? (KF8),Roz Chast,,"In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.

- Matt Haig, bestselling author of Reasons to Stay Alive
A groundbreaking picture book on depression with stunning illustrations. 
With stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori examines how depression affects one's whole outlook upon life, and shows that there can be an escape - it may not be easy to find, but it is there. Drawn from Debi's own experiences and with a moving testimony at the end of the book explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope, Debi hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.
'I have used dragons to represent depression. This is partly because of their legendary ability to turn a once fertile realm into a blackened, smoking ruin and partly because popular mythology shows them as monstrous opponents with a tendency to pick fights with smaller creatures.

David B. was born Pierre-Francois Beauchard in a small town near Orleans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.
Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Francois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history.

Fighting dragons is one way of fighting depression. This book is another.
Through stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori provides a fascinating and absorbing portrait of depression and hope in Night Shift, a moving picture book about a young girl haunted by dragons. The young girl battles the dragons using 'night skills': skills that give her both the ability to survive inside her own darkness and the knowledge that nothing--not even long, dark nights filled with monsters--will last forever.
Drawn from Gliori's own experiences and struggles with depression, the book concludes with a moving author's note explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope. Gliori hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.
A brave and powerful book, give Night Shift to dragon fighters young and old, and any reader who needs to know they're not alone.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34915616-night-shift

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.
A work of great bravery and humanity, Stitchesis a gripping and ultimately redemptive story of a man's struggle to understand the past and reclaim his voice.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7440306-stitches

A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9440024-stitches

His graphic design business has taken off, his partner, Lucie, is pregnant, it's mid-July and time to leave behind the city to go fishing. Long lazy days stretch out while Paul's thoughts wander from the colorful characters at the fish-and-game camp to the

In soft, flowing colored pencil, Delporte shows her narrator coming to terms with a rare and misunderstood sensitivity to the radiation emitted by the televisions, cell phones, and computers that permeate urban life.
On each page a few words are paired with an image or two, conveying a moment or a thought simply but effectively. Over the course of the book, the anonymous narrator moves from place to place, looking for solutions to her melancholy in the countryside via isolation and in the city with friends, sometimes turning to medication for answers. Throughout, her emotional and intellectual landscape receives as much attention as her physical surroundings.
Everywhere Antennasis the portrait of a woman caught in the margins, struggling to balance the demands of technology and modern life with the need to find meaningful relationships and work. Roughly hewn figures, sketched in pencil crayon on brightly contrasting backgrounds, populate the pages of this flowing, emotive work. With Everywhere Antennas, Delporte proves herself a master craftswoman of heartbreakingly personal, beautifully literary graphic fiction.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18465544-everywhere-antennas
illness,Swallow Me Whole,Nate Powell,illness disorder,"Swallow Me Whole is a love story carried by rolling fog, terminal illness, hallucination, apophenia, insect armies, secrets held, unshakeable faith, and the search for a master pattern to make sense of one's unraveling.
In his most ambitious book to date, Nate Powell quietly explores the dark corners of adolescence -- not the cliched melodramatic outbursts of rebellion, but the countless tiny moments of madness, the vague relief of medication, and mixed blessing of family ties. As the story unfolds, two stepsiblings hold together amidst schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, family breakdown, animal telepathy, misguided love, and the tiniest hope that everything will someday make sense.
Deliberately paced, delicately drawn, and drenched in shadows, Swallow Me Whole is a landmark achievement for Nate Powell and a suburban ghost story that will haunt readers long after its final pages.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22380715-swallow-me-whole

I fratellastri Ruth e Perry sembrano due normali teenager alle prese con i comuni problemi dell'adolescenza: pensano che il loro genitori non li capiscano, hanno ovvie paure, qualche piccola fissazione e considerano la vita un gran caos, impossibile da metter in ordine. Ma presto appare chiaro che i due non sono poi cosicomuni.: Perry e vessato da un minuscolo, prepotente mago che vive sulla sua matita e gli ordina di disegnare senza sosta, mentre Ruth e spesso circondata da enormi sciami di insetti che solo lei riesce a vedere. Ogni tentativo di mitigare i disturbi ossessivi che governano la loro vita li immerge ancora piu profondamente nel tormento della schizofrenia, fino a una conclusione surreale ma inevitabile: Ruth sfidera l'ignoranza e il settarismo della comunita in cui vive, e paghera per la propria diversita.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21399867-portami-via

illness,Epileptic,David B.,,"Hailed by The Comics Journal as one of Europe's most important and innovative comics artists, David B. has created a masterpiece in Epileptic, his stunning and emotionally resonant autobiography about growing up with an epileptic brother. Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.
David B. was born Pierre-Francois Beauchard in a small town near Orleans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.
Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Francois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Francois's grandparents and we relive his grandfathers' experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-Francois through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe""s losing battle with epilepsy. Illustrated with beautiful and striking black-and-white images, Epileptic is as astonishing, intimate, and heartbreaking as the best literary memoir.

It secured the cartoonist's place as one of his generation's most skillful and ambitious practitioners, and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family.
Mother, Come Homequietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Thomas, protected by a lion's mask that his mother gave him, constructs an identity for himself as ""the groundskeeper"": ritual and routine, already important to children that age, become paramount to him. He struggles desperately to keep up appearances while his father, a professor of symbolic logic, becomes lost in abstractions. Father and son begin to retreat into their fantasies, but only one emerges.
Mother, Come Homeis masterfully drawn: Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier's controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David's inexorable descent into utter despair.

In contrast to her last book, which was a full-length graphic memoir, The Infinite Wait is not a sustained narrative, but rather a collection of three short stories or graphic novellas. The stories in this collection contain Wertz's signature acerbic wit, ribald humour and keen eye for the everyday, but they also find the cartoonist delving into the personal. ""Industry"" catalogues 25 years of alternately terrible and terrific jobs, from selling golf balls, feeding and failing to feed animals, waitressing, and finally to cartooning and the publication of her first book. ""A Strange and Curious Place"" is a love letter to Wertz's hometown library; its mysteries and revelations, and its ability foster growth, rebellion and even artistic affirmation. The most sustained narrative in the collection, the eponymous ""The Infinite Wait,"" chronicles Wertz's move from her small hometown to San Francisco, her diagnosis with an incurable, auto-immune disease and her subsequent discovery of comics and comic making.
The collection's title, The Infinite Wait and Other Stories, intentionally and ironically recalls the vacuous and pretentious book titles of the literary elite, but these stories are the polar opposite of pretension. They are comics born out of illness, but not defined by it, and they are filled with the sometimes messy, heartbreaking and hilarious moments that make up a life.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16006353-the-infinite-wait-and-other-stories

When Jennifer Hayden was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 43, she realized that her tits told a story. Across a lifetime, they'd held so many meanings: hope and fear, pride and embarrassment, life and death. And then they were gone. Now, their story has become a way of understanding her story. Growing up flat-chested and highly aware of her inadequacies... heading off to college, where she ""bloomed"" in more ways than one... navigating adulthood between her mother's mastectomy, her father's mistress, and her musician boyfriend's problems of his own--not to mention his sprawling family. Then the kids come along... As cancer strikes three different lives, some relationships crumble while others emerge even stronger, and this sarcastic child of the '70s finally finds a goddess she can believe in.
For everyone who's faced cancer personally, or watched a loved one fight that battle, Hayden's story is a much-needed breath of fresh air, an irresistible blend of sweetness and skepticism. Rich with both symbolism & humor, The Story of My Tits will leave you laughing, weeping, and feeling grateful for every day.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25652567-the-story-of-my-tits

Throughout it all, Olivier, an accomplished visual artist, drew.

In ""Bitter Medicine,"" Olivier's poignant graphic narrative runs alongside and communicates with a written account of the past three decades by his younger brother, award-winning author and playwright Clem Martini.

Shortly before her thirtieth birthday, Forney was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Flagrantly manic and terrified that medications would cause her to lose creativity, she began a years-long struggle to find mental stability while retaining her passions and creativity.
Searching to make sense of the popular concept of the crazy artist, she finds inspiration from the lives and work of other artists and writers who suffered from mood disorders, including Vincent van Gogh, Georgia O'Keeffe, William Styron, and Sylvia Plath. She also researches the clinical aspects of bipolar disorder, including the strengths and limitations of various treatments and medications, and what studies tell us about the conundrum of attempting to ""cure"" an otherwise brilliant mind.

QU33Ris an all-new project featuring queer comics legends as well as new talents that picks up where No Straight Linesleft off. We've set down our history, now QU33Rshines a light on our future!
QU33Rhad its genesis in an all-color queer comic zine called THREE, which featured three stories by three creators or teams per issue. Rob Kirby published three installments of THREEannually from 2010 to 2012, and the series did well, garnering not only an Ignatz nomination for Outstanding Anthology or Collection but also earning Rob the Prism Comics Queer Press Grant in 2011.
Producing the anthology was immensely gratifying, but featuring just three comics and publishing only once per year meant a lot of cartoonists weren't getting the exposure they deserved. The publishing opportunities for queer cartoonists and queer subject matter are still limited, even today, and Rob longed for a wider distribution than he was able to manage on his own. He approached Northwest Press about doing a bigger compendium of all-new work.
While THREEwas happening, Justin Hall was preparing his book No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics, which Fantagraphics published in the summer of 2012. No Straight Linestraced the history of queer comics from their humble beginnings in the late '60s/early '70s all the way up to the present. The book was a whopping, award-winning success. Rob got to thinking that a follow-up volume--a sort-of-sequel focusing on all new work--would seal the deal, informing the world at large that we are still here, still queer, and still producing fresh and innovative work. He wanted to include not only several queer comics veterans, but also some fresh new faces and a few folks who haven't necessarily belonged to the orthodox ""queer comics scene"" but have been doing non-heteronormative work all along.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20637657-qu33r

In this brilliant gem of a book, artist/writer Leanne Shapton weaves together a voyeuristic tale of love and life through epigrammatic vignettes and sleek line drawings. Entire relationships are encapsulated in a few, stingingly perfect lines: ""Colleen was Walter's ex-girlfriend from med school. She loved to dance with men at weddings."" Pricking our insecurities, Shapton introduces us to Kim, whose ex ""kept a drawerful of love letters in a kitchen drawer . . . She would stare at it while she cooked."" And Ben's ex, ""a physiotherapist for the U.S. men's and women's Olympic swim teams. She wore small white shorts year-round.""
Fascinated by her own jealousy, Shapton interviewed acquaintances about their anxieties and peccadilloes, and the result is a book of surpassing originality: one of those unusual books that comes along to delight us all, like An Exaltation of Larksor Love, Loss, and What I Woreor Griffin and Sabine. Was She Pretty?can also share the shelf with the work of the legendary William Steig, whose early, psychologically revealing work inspired Shapton.

ill,The Book of Leviathan,Peter Blegvad,,"Welcome to a new strange world. In a dazzling work of graphic fiction, a surreal journey through a wonderland eerily like real life, The Book of Leviathan chronicles an infant's investigations into life's great mysteries. Endowed with a preternatural interest in metaphysics and philosophy, yet as confused as any innocent by the vagaries of adult behavior, little Levi bears the added burden of living in a world that can literally change at the stroke of a pen.
Aided by a wise pet (""Cat"") and a favorite toy (""Bunny""), Levi encounters a frothing ectoplasmic Hegel and a woefully off-the-mark Freud. In less heady adventures, Levi contemplates why his parents disappear at night (and whether he is wholeheartedly pleased when they return each morning); the regrettable liberties taken with the English language; and the relationship between Bennetton and Pablo Neruda.
Peter Blegvad's Book of Leviathan assembles the cream from Levi and Cat's adventures, published in The Independent on Sunday newspaper in the twilight years of the old Millennium. Blegvad's darkly humorous work has been described by Matt Groening as ""one of the weirdest things I've ever stared at"". Quirky and referential, dark and droll by turn, it follows the faceless baby Levi's journeys into and out of the world. They are escapes, but as some sage once observed, only a jailer would consider the term ""escapist"" pejorative.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16616.The_Book_of_Leviathan

But despite their ubiquity, Archie comics have been relatively ignored by scholars--until now.
Twelve-Cent Archieis not only the first scholarly study of the Archie comic, it is an innovative creative work in its own right. Inspired by Archie's own concise storytelling format, renowned comics scholar Bart Beaty divides the book into a hundred short chapters, each devoted to a different aspect of the Archie comics. Fans of the comics will be thrilled to read in-depth examinations of their favorite characters and motifs, including individual chapters devoted to Jughead's hat and Archie's sweater-vest. But the book also has plenty to interest newcomers to Riverdale, as it recounts the behind-the-scenes history of the comics and analyzes how Archie helped shape our images of the American teenager.
As he employs a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches, Beaty reveals that the Archie comics themselves were far more eclectic, creative, and self-aware than most critics recognize. Equally comfortable considering everything from the representation of racial diversity to the semiotics of Veronica's haircut, Twelve-Cent Archiegives a fresh appreciation for America's most endearing group of teenagers.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21975960-twelve-cent-archie

It's easy to understand why Vanessa Davis has taken the comics industry by storm and is poised to do the same with the world at large--her comics are pure chutzpah, gorgeously illustrated in watercolors. No story is too painful to tell--like how much she enjoyed fat camp. Nor too off-limits--like her critique of R. Crumb. Nor too personal--like her stories of growing up Jewish in Florida. Using her sweet but biting wit, Davis effortlessly carves out a wholly original and refreshing niche in two well-worn territories: autobio comics and the Jewish identity.
Davis draws strips from her daily diary, centering on her youth, mother, relationships with men, and eventually her longtime boyfriend. Her intimacy, self-deprecation, and candor have deservedly earned her many accolades and awards. Her deft comedic touch, lush color, and immediacy will set Davis apart not only as one of the premier cartoonists, but as one of the leading humorists for her generation, too.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8589579-make-me-a-woman

Nichols Marian Runk MariNaomi Michael Fahy Nicole J. Georges Rick Worley Sasha Steinberg Sina Sparrow Steve MacIsaac Terrance Griep Jr. Tyler Cohen,,"In 2012, Justin Hall edited a book called No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics, that took readers on a journey from the beginnings of LGBT comics history to the present day. QU33Ris an all-new project featuring queer comics legends as well as new talents that picks up where No Straight Linesleft off. We've set down our history, now QU33Rshines a light on our future!
QU33Rhad its genesis in an all-color queer comic zine called THREE, which featured three stories by three creators or teams per issue. Rob Kirby published three installments of THREEannually from 2010 to 2012, and the series did well, garnering not only an Ignatz nomination for Outstanding Anthology or Collection but also earning Rob the Prism Comics Queer Press Grant in 2011.
Producing the anthology was immensely gratifying, but featuring just three comics and publishing only once per year meant a lot of cartoonists weren't getting the exposure they deserved. The publishing opportunities for queer cartoonists and queer subject matter are still limited, even today, and Rob longed for a wider distribution than he was able to manage on his own. He approached Northwest Press about doing a bigger compendium of all-new work.
While THREEwas happening, Justin Hall was preparing his book No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics, which Fantagraphics published in the summer of 2012. No Straight Linestraced the history of queer comics from their humble beginnings in the late '60s/early '70s all the way up to the present. The book was a whopping, award-winning success. Rob got to thinking that a follow-up volume--a sort-of-sequel focusing on all new work--would seal the deal, informing the world at large that we are still here, still queer, and still producing fresh and innovative work. He wanted to include not only several queer comics veterans, but also some fresh new faces and a few folks who haven't necessarily belonged to the orthodox ""queer comics scene"" but have been doing non-heteronormative work all along.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19546513-qu33r

ill,Fallen Words,Yoshihiro Tatsumi Jocelyne Allen,,"A NEW COLLECTION OF STORIES FROM THE FOREFATHER OF THE JAPANESE LITERARY COMICS MOVEMENT
In Fallen Words, Yoshihiro Tatsumi takes up the oral tradition of rakugo and breathes new life into it by shifting the format from spoken word to manga. Each of the eight stories in the collection is lifted from the Edo-era Japanese storytelling form. As Tatsumi notes in the afterword, the world of rakugo, filled with mystery, emotion, revenge, hope, and, of course, love, overlaps perfectly with the world of Gekiga that he has spent the better part of his life developing.
These slice-of-life stories resonate with modern readers thanks to their comedic elements and familiarity with human idiosyncrasies. In one, a father finds his son too bookish and arranges for two workers to take the young man to a brothel on the pretext of visiting a new shrine. In another particularly beloved rakugo tale, a married man falls in love with a prostitute. When his wife finds out, she is enraged and sets a curse on the other woman. The prostitute responds by cursing the wife, and the two escalate in a spiral of voodoo doll cursing. Soon both are dead, but even death can't extinguish their jealousy.
Tatsumi's love of wordplay shines through in the telling of these whimsical stories, and yet he still offers timeless insight into human nature.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13034896-fallen-words

Like a message in a bottle, a ""missed connection"" classified (usually posted on a website) is an attempt however far-fetched, by one stranger to reach another on the strength of a remembered glance, smile, orblue hat. The anonymous messages are hopeful and hopeless, funny and sad. Ms. Blackall, award-winning illustrator of Ruby's Wishand Big Red Lollipop, has turned some of the most evocative (or hilarious) of them into exquisite paintings.
Missed Connectionsis a collection of illustrated love stories. There's ""We Shared a Bear Suit."" ""If Not for Your Noisy Tambourine."" ""Hairy Bearded Swimmer."" Each is told in the shorthand of a ""missed connection,"" and then illustrated in Chinese ink and watercolor. The paintings are extraordinary: delicate yet full of feeling, each springing from one little detail of the post into a fully imagined world. Each brings the voyeuristic pleasure of watching love at first sight, and the pleasure of watching an artist discover a fresh new way to tell a story. And not all the connections are missed.

ill,The Book of Leviathan,Peter Blegvad,,"Welcome to a new strange world.In a dazzling work of graphic fiction, a surreal journey through a wonderland eerily like real life, The Book of Leviathan chronicles an infant's investigations into life's great mysteries. Endowed with a preternatural interest in metaphysics and philosophy, yet as confused as any innocent by the vagaries of adult behavior, little Levi bears the added burden of living in a world that can literally change at the stroke of a pen.
Aided by a wise pet (""Cat"") and a favorite toy (""Bunny""), Levi encounters a frothing ectoplasmic Hegel and a woefully off-the-mark Freud. In less heady adventures, Levi contemplates why his parents disappear at night (and whether he is wholeheartedly pleased when they return each morning); the regrettable liberties taken with the English language; and the relationship between Bennetton and Pablo Neruda.
Peter Blegvad's Book of Leviathan assembles the cream from Levi and Cat's adventures, published in The Independent on Sunday newspaper in the twilight years of the old Millennium. Blegvad's darkly humorous work has been described by Matt Groening as ""one of the weirdest things I've ever stared at"". Quirky and referential, dark and droll by turn, it follows the faceless baby Levi's journeys into and out of the world.

Ivory Coast, 1978. It's a golden time, and the nation, too--an oasis of affluence and stability in West Africa--seems fueled by something wondrous.

Nothing could better express the essence of Franz Kafka, a man described by his friends as living behind a ""glass wall."" Kafka wrote in the tradition of the great Yiddish storytellers, whose stock-in-trade was bizarre fantasy tainted with hilarity and self-abasement. What he added to this tradition was an almost unbearably expanded consciousness. Alienated from his roots, his family, his surroundings, and primarily from his own body, Kafka created a unique literary language in which to hide away, transforming himself into a cockroach, an ape, a dog, a mole or a circus artiste who starves himself to death in front of admiring crowds.
David Zane Mairowitz's brilliant text and the illustrations and comic panels of the world's greatest cartoonist, Robert Crumb (himself no stranger to self-loathing and alienation), help us to understand the essence of Kafka and provide insight beyond the cliche ""Kafkaesque,"" peering through Kafka's glass wall like no other book before it. The book is a wonderful educational tool for those unfamiliar with Kafka, including a brief but inclusive biography as well as the plots of many of his works, all illustrated by Crumb, making this newly designed edition a must-have for admirers of both Kafka and Crumb.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237849.Kafka

When a mysterious nomad girl is offered up as an item of trade, she seeks refuge by forming a tenacious friendship with the local cave-painter turned outcast. Together they set out on a dangerous mission to bring truth to their corrupt tribe with the help of their new discovery (via some psychotropic mushrooms): drawings that tell a story. Subsequently, they become enmeshed in the violent power struggles and sensual intrigues between the alpha males and alpha females.
In Sanctuary, art, inspiration, and communication is in conflict with tradition and law, and the novel dramatizes the moral imperative of man facing the truth even at the cost of his, and society's, lives.

ill,Everything Together: Collected Stories,Sammy Harkham,,"Sammy Harkham is one of the most influential cartoonists and comics editors of his generation. After a decade of work and groundbreaking anthologies, ""Everything Together"" collects his short-story comics, which condense vast amounts of emotion and information into nuanced cartoon narratives. Harkham's classic style is both articulate and expedient. At the center of the book are two vastly different tales: ""Poor Sailor,"" a sea-faring myth of a man gone to find wealth for his love; and ""Somersaulting,"" a kind of fever dream of teenagers in love, wiling away the summer. Alongside these stories are shorter comic strips tackling everything from Napoleon as a tortured artist to touching examinations of Jewish mysticism and life in a shtetl, to satires on contemporary university life. Throughout these tales, Harkham maintains a light touch and emotive wit. The works in this book confirm his place among the best storytellers of his generation.
Sammy Harkham was born in Los Angeles in 1980, moving to Sydney, Australia, at the age of 14. He soon started making his own comics and a zine, ""Kramers Ergot,"" which has evolved into one of the most influential comics anthologies published today. His comic strip ""Poor Sailor,"" originally published in ""Kramers Ergot"" 4, was subsequently included in ""Best American Nonrequired Reading of 2004 ""and has been published in French, Korean and Italian. ""Kramers Ergot"" has been on numerous ""best of the year"" lists including the ""LA Weekly,"" ""Time,"" ""The New York Times,"" ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""The Comics Journal"" and ""Publishers Weekly."" In 2006 Harkham started the ongoing comic series, ""Crickets,"" and edited ""The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror,"" and most recently the eighth volume of ""Kramers Ergot.""

With Artichoke Tales, six years in the making, Kelso expands her range (and her page count) by creating a family saga spanning three generations and an entire continent.'
Artichoke Talesis a 176-page coming-of-age story about a young girl named Brigitte whose family is caught between the two warring sides of a civil war, a graphic novel that takes place in a world that echoes our own, but whose people have artichoke leaves instead of hair. Influenced in equal parts by Little House on the Prairie, The Thorn Birds, Dharma Bums, and Cold Mountain, Kelso weaves a moving story about family amidst war. Kelso's visual storytelling, uniquely combining delicate linework with rhythmic, musical page compositions, creates a dramatic tension between intimate, ruminative character studies and the unflinching depiction of the consequences of war and carnage, lending cohesion and resonance to a generational epic. This is Kelso's first new work in four years; the widespread critical reception of her previous work makes Artichoke Talesone of the most eagerly anticipated graphic novels of 2010.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7607149-artichoke-tales

ill,A Single Match,Oji Suzuki,,"A new author in D+Q's acclaimed gekigaline
In this collection of hauntingly elliptical short stories, Oji Suzuki explores memory, relationships, and loss with a loose narrative style, filling each tale with a sense of unfulfilled longing. He plumbs the dissolute depths of human psychology, literally bathing his characters in expansive shadows that paradoxically reveal as much as they obscure. A young man catches a cold after being soaked in the rain and is tended to by his grandmother. He drifts, dreaming of a train trip with an older brother he doesn't have. A traveling salesman comes across a boy lying in the middle of the road and stops to have a cigarette and tell a story that sifts through memories of faces and places before settling back on the boy and pretending to not look at the stars. A young woman walks along the river with her bicycle and a friend who is nothing more than a disembodied head--discussing past times together, memories they have of each other.
Although he touches on many of the same themes as his contemporaries in the field of postwar alternative manga--Yoshihiro Tsuge (L'Homme Sans Talent) and Seiichi Hayashi (Red Coloured Elegy)--Suzuki uses an ever shifting narrative approach and dashes of surrealist humor to distinguish his work from that of his peers.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713189-a-single-match

ill,Beta Testing the Apocalypse,Tom Kaczynski,,"It would be easy to call Tom Kaczynski the J.G. Ballard of comics. Like Ballard, Kaczynski s comics riff on dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments.Yet while Kaczynski shares many of Ballard s obsessions, he processes them in unique ways. His visual storytelling adds an architectural dimension that the written word alone lacks.
Kaczynski takes abstract ideas capitalism, communism, or utopianism and makes them tangible. He depicts and meditates on the immense political and technological structures and spaces we inhabit that subtly affect and define the limits of who we are and the freedom we as Americans presume to enjoy. Society and the individual, in perpetual tension. Once you've read Kaczynski s comics, it should come as no surprise to learn that he studied architecture before embarking on a career as a cartoonist.
Beta Testing includes approximately 10 short stories, most notably The New, a brand new story created expressly for this book. It s Kaczynski s longest story to date. The New is set in an un-named third-world megalopolis. It could be Dhaka, Lagos or Mumbai. The city creaks under the pressure of explosive growth. Whole districts are built in a week. The story follows an internationally renowned starchitect as he struggles to impose his vision on the metropolis. A vision threatened by the massive dispossessed slum-proletariat inhabiting the slums and favelas on the edges of the city.

ill,The Abominable Mr. Seabrook,Joe Ollmann,,"In the early twentieth century, travel writing represented the desire for the expanding bourgeoisie to experience the exotic cultures of the world past their immediate surroundings. Journalist William Buehler Seabrook was emblematic of this trend--participating in voodoo ceremonies, riding camels cross the Sahara desert, communing with cannibals and most notably, popularizing the term ""zombie"" in the West. A string of his bestselling books show an engaged, sympathetic gentleman hoping to share these strange, hidden delights with the rest of the world. He was willing to go deeper than any outsider had before. But, of course, there was a dark side. Seabrook was a barely functioning alcoholic who was deeply obsessed with bondage and the so-called mystical properties of pain and degradation. His life was a series of traveling highs and drunken lows; climbing on and falling off the wagon again and again. What led the popular and vivid writer to such a sad state?
Cartoonist Joe Ollmann spent seven years researching Seabrook's life, interviewing surviving family and accessing long neglected archives, in order to piece together the peripatetic life of a forgotten American writer. Often weaving in Seabrook's own words and those of his biographers, Ollmann's The Abominable Mr. Seabrook posits Seabrook the believer versus Seabrook the exploiter, and leaves the reader to consider where one ends and the other begins.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29875927-the-abominable-mr-seabrook

Tom is a solid, but not great, musician. While his bandmates are happy to play gigs for themselves at their own clubs, drinking free beer and shooting the breeze, Tom aches for the next level, whatever that is. And as musicians are wont to do in magical fables, he meets a mysterious stranger with a seemingly simple offer: take a battered old trumpet for free, and just enjoy it, no exchanges and no strings. Whenever Tom plays it, the extraordinary music blows away his growing throngs of fans, and deadly mishaps start to follow. Tom may not have sold his soul for the music of the heavens, but he seems to have bargained away something much more serious.

ill,Hall Of Best Knowledge,Ray Fenwick,,"Ray Fenwick has pioneered his own medium of storytelling, one best described as ""typographical comics."" Hall of Best Knowledgeis presented as a handsome, personal journal written by an unnamed voice, referred to only as ""The Author."" Little is known about him; he makes occasional, derogatory references to a twin brother and younger sibling, but reveals little else. He clearly fashions himself a genius, writing with a faux-aristocratic air, and it is presumably his belief in his own genius that leads him to want to share his knowledge with the world. Each page features information such as ""It hardly needs mentioning that riding a pony is no intellectual triumph.... If riding a pony is so fantastic, why have I never read of any renowned pony-riding genius? It is because such a person does not exist, making it a foolish waste of time unworthy of attention."" These pearls of wisdom are lettered in an elegant, almost obsessive fashion, entirely hand-crafted and bedecked with Ionic columns and fleurs-de-lis.
It becomes obvious to the reader early on that all is not as it seems; only at the end does the picture become completely clear. The ensuing journey is a riotous tour through the narrator's ego and id, and the humor builds accordingly as he is revealed to be not nearly as smart--or sophisticated--as he thinks.
Hall of Best Knowledgeis part graphic novel, part art object, part satire, part puzzle. The slow unfolding of the author and his story builds humor with each page, creating a peculiar examination of the idea of genius and the problems that arise in the search and transmission of knowledge.

You Can't Get There From Here, the longest story of the book (and the only one to be printed in color well, a color), tells the tale of a love triangle involving Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and The Monster's Bride: Jason cleverly alternates between totally silent sequences involving the three characters and scenes in which Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant discusses the day s events with a fellow hunchbacked assistant to another mad scientist. (You didn't know they had a union?) Tell Me Something is a brisk (271 panels), near-totally-silent (just a few intertitles) graphic novelette about love lost and found again, told with a tricky mixture of forward- and back-flashing narrative. Meow, Baby is a collection of Jason's short stories and gags, and finally, The Living and the Dead is a hilariously deadpan (and gory) take on the traditional Romero-style zombie thriller.

Within a general atmosphere of a dazed freneticism, he offers uncanny and excessive portraits, synthetically luminous abstractions, and somewhat narrative compilations of drawings, which he creates using a unique photo-chemical process. Together, they exist in a world that can't decide whether it's awake or asleep, gorgeous or vaguely psychedelic. Girls figure largely in Smith's universe. According to the Whitney Museum catalogue, ""his stylized portraits and acidic abstractions intimately capture stillness in an ever-encroaching world, while demonstrating a deconstructed neo-punk aesthetic conversant in comic book-style drawing, vivid psychedelic coloration, experimental photographic processes, and traditional draftsmanship."" Using his friends and his immediate environment as subjects, Smith renders scenes of youthful ambivalence amid a surplus of surrounding diversions and possessions. Smith's works include acrylic portraits based on scenes from his life and images created using experimental photographic techniques. Central to his work is a balance of seemingly disparate aesthetic modes. Using visual elements from painting, drawing, and photography, Smith achieves a hybrid effect that vacillates between sober realism and electrifying abstraction.

In contrast to her last book, which was a full-length graphic memoir, The Infinite Wait is not a sustained narrative, but rather a collection of three short stories or graphic novellas. The stories in this collection contain Wertz's signature acerbic wit, ribald humour and keen eye for the everyday, but they also find the cartoonist delving into the personal. ""Industry"" catalogues 25 years of alternately terrible and terrific jobs, from selling golf balls, feeding and failing to feed animals, waitressing, and finally to cartooning and the publication of her first book. ""A Strange and Curious Place"" is a love letter to Wertz's hometown library; its mysteries and revelations, and its ability foster growth, rebellion and even artistic affirmation. The most sustained narrative in the collection, the eponymous ""The Infinite Wait,"" chronicles Wertz's move from her small hometown to San Francisco, her diagnosis with an incurable, auto-immune disease and her subsequent discovery of comics and comic making.
The collection's title, The Infinite Wait and Other Stories, intentionally and ironically recalls the vacuous and pretentious book titles of the literary elite, but these stories are the polar opposite of pretension. They are comics born out of illness, but not defined by it, and they are filled with the sometimes messy, heartbreaking and hilarious moments that make up a life.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16006353-the-infinite-wait-and-other-stories

May 28, 1828, marked the beginning of the official life of Kaspar Hauser, a young man who appeared mysteriously in the streets of Nuremberg and died of knife wounds five years later under equally mysterious circumstances. ""Europe's child,"" as pamphleteers referred to him, captured the imagination of salon society. Allegedly raised in a dark cellar and deprived of human contact until the age of sixteen, he became the proof of a concept for theories about natural man, original sin, and the civilizing mission of culture. Rightful heir to the throne of Baden or a fraud? Redeemer of man's sins or ""ambulatory automatist""? The curious circumstances and significance of his life have been disputed ever since.
In Kaspar, Quebec cartoonist Diane Obomsawin draws on Hauser's own writings, and contemporary accounts, to tell the foundling's strange story. Minimalist grayscale panels and the simplest of line work register the wonder and bewilderment of a trusting and sensitive soul emerging into a fickle society.

The Lagoonwas influenced by the films Creature from the Black Lagoonand Night of the Hunter, but reads more like the gothic, family narratives of Flannery O'Connor or Carson McCullers. Rhythms--Grandpa's taps, the ticking of a metronome--are punctuated by silences that pace this ""sound""-driven story. Older teen and adult readers are invited to imagine the enigmatic creature's haunting, ever-shifting tune as it reverberates through weedy waters, eventually escaping the lagoon to creep into windows at night.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4610834-the-lagoon

Growing up flat-chested and highly aware of her inadequacies... heading off to college, where she ""bloomed"" in more ways than one... navigating adulthood between her mother's mastectomy, her father's mistress, and her musician boyfriend's problems of his own--not to mention his sprawling family. Then the kids come along... As cancer strikes three different lives, some relationships crumble while others emerge even stronger, and this sarcastic child of the '70s finally finds a goddess she can believe in.
For everyone who's faced cancer personally, or watched a loved one fight that battle, Hayden's story is a much-needed breath of fresh air, an irresistible blend of sweetness and skepticism.

""My reaction to each new Simon's Cat video or book is the same: YAY!! In this brand-new collection, acclaimed cartoonist Simon Tofield tackles every cat owner's nightmare: going to the vet. It tells the story of how Simon's Cat seems to instinctively know a trip to the vet is about to happen and the lengths he'll go to avoid it, while long-suffering Simon is forced to try all kinds of tricks to get him to cooperate.

In the last five years, Simon's Cat has become a global phenomenon. Star of thirty-nine films, which have been watched over 500 million times, and winner of a dozen major industry awards, Simon's Cat has captured the hearts of a worldwide audience. In this brand-new book we see Simon's Cat face any feline's most dreaded scenario--he's off to the vet. And he's not at all happy about it.
Sharing its theme with the first-ever full-color Simon's Cat feature animation, funded by a record-breaking Indiegogo campaign and due to be released alongside the new book, Simon's Cat Off to the Vet...and Other Cat-astrophesis packed with over 240 pages of hilarious new gags and adventures featuring our favorite furry friend and his companions--both old and new.
Says Tofield: ""Taking my naughty cat to the vet is one of the most requested film ideas from our fans. It was because of this that I started work on a new film and book based on the crazy situations that arise during these trips! A visit to the vet can be quite a stressful time in real life for both cats and their owners, however my goal is to bring out the comedy, and introduce a cast of extra characters for Simon's Cat to meet, as he gets his claws into his new surroundings!""",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25074280-simon-s-cat-off-to-the-vet-and-other-cat-astrophes

Sohei would immediately launch an investigation to the murder, but almost instantly all traces of information regarding his younger brother's study in Germany has vanished. The police were of no help. Isao's room was also cleared and rented out to another person. Even his building manager feined ignorance. It was as if he had never existed.

ill,Kafka - Per cominciare,David Zane Mairowitz Robert Crumb,,"""Che cos'ho in comune con gli ebrei? Non ho neppure niente in comune con me stesso."" Questa battuta, meglio di qualsiasi altra, esprime l'essenza di Franz Kafka. Un uomo che veniva descritto dai suoi amici come uno che sembrava vivesse dietro una parete d vetro.
Kafka scrisse nella tradizione dei grandi narratori jiddish, attingendo a un patrimonio culturale caratterizzato da una fantasia bizzarra venata di sfumature di umorismo e automortificazione. Cio che aggiunse a questa tradizione fu una conspevolezza ossessiva. Alienato dalle sue radici, dalla sua famiglia, dal suo ambiente, e soprattutto dl suo stesso corpo, Kafka ha creato un linguaggio letterario unico nel quale nascondersi, trasformandosi in uno scarafaggio, in una scimmia, un cane, una talpa o un artista del circo che si lascia morire di fame davanti a una folla ammirata.

In a return to the literary and thematic territory of Lemire's breakthrough graphic novel ESSEX COUNTY, ROYAL CITY follows Patrick Pike, a fading literary star who reluctantly returns to the once-thriving factory town where he grew up. Patrick is quickly drawn back into the dramas of his two adult siblings, his overbearing Mother and his brow beaten Father, all of whom are still haunted by different versions of his youngest brother, Tommy, who drowned decades ago.
As each member of the family struggles to keep themselves above water, it quickly becomes clear that Tommy's death isn't the only dark secret tearing the town, and this family, apart at the seams. Can each member of the Pike family come to terms with their own guilt over Tommy's death, and make peace with the many versions of Tommy that still haunt them, or will they all be dragged down below the river along with his lingering ghost?
ROYAL CITY promises to be a sprawling, serialized graphic novel that will chart the lives, loves and losses of a troubled family and a vanishing town, across three decades.
Jeff Lemire is the creator of DESCENDER (with DUSTIN NGUYEN), AD: AFTER DEATH (with SCOTT SNYDER), ROUGHNECK, SECRET PATH (with Gord Downie), PLUTONA (with EMI LENNOX), ESSEX COUNTY, SWEET TOOTH, TRILLIUM, and THE UNDERWATER WELDER.

depression,Susanna Moodie: Roughing It in the Bush,Carol Shields Patrick Crowe Willow Dawson Selena Goulding,,"A subject of fascination for writers like Margaret Atwood and Timothy Findley, Susanna Moodie was a Romantic writer from a celebrated literary family whose life changed forever when she and her husband embarked from England for the backwoods of Canada in 1832. Misled by land merchants, the Moodies discovered that settlement in Upper Canada was far from pastoral, but rather a wild frontier. Utterly unprepared for pioneer life, they soon found themselves starving in a hostile wilderness. With her husband absent in the army during the 1837 Rebellion, Susanna began publishing her writing to feed and clothe her growing family. The result was the novel Roughing It in the Bush--Moodie's aggravated and acerbic testament of pioneer life was praised in England but turned her into a controversial figure. Two centuries later she is now honored as an early feminist and literary pioneer.
Susanna Moodie: Roughing It in the Bush brings the words of this controversial yet fascinating woman to life through the insightful personality of Carol Shields.

Even better, the book shows the strength and support to be found within and around us to tame this shaggy beast and ultimately bring it to heel.

depression,Vincent,Barbara Stok Camila Werner,,"Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) e sua mente torturada conceberam uma arte fascinante que transcendeu sua propria historia para se tornar um dos mais expressivos e maravilhosos conjuntos de pinturas jamais concebidos. Nesta graphic novel de tracos pop originalissimos, Barbara Stok retrata de forma delicada e luminosa os ultimos anos da vida do pintor holandes, passados na Franca, onde encontrou nao apenas seu fim, mas tambem a natureza e a luz que imortalizou em seus quadros.
Em 1888, apos uma estadia de dois anos em Paris, Vincent van Gogh muda-se para Arles, no sul da Franca. A luminosidade, os espacos abertos e as paisagens bucolicas da regiao, alem do proprio contato com a natureza, fornecem ao artista a materia-prima para aquela que e considerada a fase mais rica e revolucionaria de sua arte.
Se por um lado o ambiente o enche de contentamento e esperanca, por outro agravam-se seu desequilibrio e sua angustia, piorados ainda pela falta de dinheiro e de perspectivas concretas de futuro e pela culpa de ser um fardo para o irmao, Theo, que o sustentava financeiramente.
E esse turbulento e rico periodo, nao apenas crucial para a compreensao do genio Van Gogh como tambem emblematico de sua existencia, que a artista grafica Barbara Stok retrata, com um colorido e uma singeleza dignos do genio holandes. Barbara pinta com todas as cores um Vincent humano, com suas ambiguidades e fraquezas. Incorporando sabiamente trechos de cartas escritas ao irmao Theo e telas do proprio pintor, aborda seu processo criativo, suas ideias sobre pintura e a obcecada conviccao em sua propria arte, que sempre o guiou. O resultado e um personagem cativante, repleto de nuances, e que emociona por sua arte e tambem pela pureza da paixao com que a perseguia.
Barbara Stok nasceu em 1970 em Groningen, na Holanda. Trabalhou como fotografa e jornalista ate estrear, em 1998, com o livro de tiras Barbaraal tot op het bot, no qual retratava o proprio cotidiano. Seu traco original, sua narrativa delicada e sua maneira de ampliar pequenos detalhes da existencia fizeram sucesso.

But then a deadly new threat appears, as if out of nowhere. Bane. Huge, powerful, and terrifyingly methodical, Bane is bent on spreading chaos and death. Commissioner Gordon and the GCPD are unable to stop him and have nowhere to turn. But after so many years, can the Dark Knight once again save Gotham from its gravest threat yet?

depression,The End of the Fucking World,Charles Forsman,,"TEotFW follows James and Alyssa, two teenagers living a seemingly typical teen experience as they face the fear of coming adulthood. Forsman tells their story through each character's perspective, jumping between points of view with each chapter. But quickly, this somewhat familiar teenage experience takes a more nihilistic turn as James's character exhibits a rapidly forming sociopathy that threatens both of their futures. He harbors violent fantasies and begins to act on them, while Alyssa remains as willfully ignorant for as long as she can, blinded by young love. Forsman's story highlights the disdain, fear and existential search that many teenagers fear, but through a road trip drama that owes as much to Badlands as The Catcher in the Rye. Forsman's inviting, Charles Schulz-influenced style lends a deadpan quality that underscores the narrative's tension. The End of the Fucking World is certain to be one of the most talked-about graphic novels of 2013. Forsman is arguably the most acclaimed talent to come out of the Center for Cartoon Studies, a school founded in 2004 by graphic novelist James Sturm and educator Michelle Ollie in White River Junction, VT. Forsman graduated in 2008 and is a two-time Ignatz Award-winner for his self-published minicomic, Snake Oil.

depression,The Storm in the Barn,Matt Phelan,illness,"Tall tale. Thriller. Gripping historical fiction. This artful, sparely told graphic novel -- a tale of a boy in Dust Bowl America -- will resonate with young readers today.
In Kansas in the year 1937, eleven-year-old Jack Clark faces his share of ordinary challenges: local bullies, his father's failed expectations, a little sister with an eye for trouble. But he also has to deal with the effects of the Dust Bowl, including rising tensions in his small town and the spread of a shadowy illness. Certainly a case of ""dust dementia"" would explain who (or what) Jack has glimpsed in the Talbot's abandoned barn -- a sinister figure with a face like rain. In a land where it never rains, it's hard to trust what you see with your own eyes -- and harder still to take heart and be a hero when the time comes. With phenomenal pacing, sensitivity, and a sure command of suspense, Matt Phelan ushers us into a world where desperation is transformed by unexpected courage.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493836-the-storm-in-the-barn

Fighting dragons is one way of fighting depression. This book is another.
Through stunning black and white illustration and deceptively simple text, author and illustrator Debi Gliori provides a fascinating and absorbing portrait of depression and hope in Night Shift, a moving picture book about a young girl haunted by dragons. The young girl battles the dragons using 'night skills': skills that give her both the ability to survive inside her own darkness and the knowledge that nothing--not even long, dark nights filled with monsters--will last forever.
Drawn from Gliori's own experiences and struggles with depression, the book concludes with a moving author's note explaining how depression has affected her and how she continues to cope. Gliori hopes that by sharing her own experience she can help others who suffer from depression, and to find that subtle shift that will show the way out.

depression,The Hypo: The Melancholic Young Lincoln,Noah Van Sciver,depression,"The debut graphic novel from Noah Van Sciver follows the twentysomething Abraham Lincoln as he loses everything, long before becoming our most beloved president. Lincoln is a rising Whig in the state's legislature as he arrives in Springfield, IL to practice law. With all of his possessions under his arms in two saddlebags, he is quickly given a place to stay by a womanizing young bachelor who becomes his friend and close confidant. Lincoln builds a life and begins friendships with the town's top lawyers and politicians. He attends elegant dances and meets an independent-minded young woman from a high-society Kentucky family, and after a brisk courtship, becomes engaged. But, as time passes and uncertainty creeps in, young Lincoln is forced to battle a dark cloud of depression brought on by a chain of defeats and failures culminating into a nervous breakdown that threatens his life and sanity. This cloud of dark depression Lincoln calls ""The Hypo."" Dense crosshatching and an attention to detail help bring together this completely original telling of a man driven by an irrepressible desire to pull himself up by his bootstraps, overcome all obstacles, and become the person he strives to be. All the while, unknowingly laying the foundation of character he would use as one of America's greatest presidents.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14475543-the-hypo

It secured the cartoonist's place as one of his generation's most skillful and ambitious practitioners, and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family.
Mother, Come Homequietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Thomas, protected by a lion's mask that his mother gave him, constructs an identity for himself as ""the groundskeeper"": ritual and routine, already important to children that age, become paramount to him. He struggles desperately to keep up appearances while his father, a professor of symbolic logic, becomes lost in abstractions. Father and son begin to retreat into their fantasies, but only one emerges.
Mother, Come Homeis masterfully drawn: Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier's controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David's inexorable descent into utter despair. Hornschemeier is equally precise when it comes to Mother, Come Home's color palette: subdued but warm, which suits the story's melancholy and contemplative mode.

Searching to make sense of the popular concept of the crazy artist, she finds inspiration from the lives and work of other artists and writers who suffered from mood disorders, including Vincent van Gogh, Georgia O'Keeffe, William Styron, and Sylvia Plath. She also researches the clinical aspects of bipolar disorder, including the strengths and limitations of various treatments and medications, and what studies tell us about the conundrum of attempting to ""cure"" an otherwise brilliant mind.

Long a fixture in comics anthologies, David Heatley's deceptively crude, wickedly observant drawings have begun showing up on the New York Timesop-ed pages and the cover of the New Yorker, introducing him to a vast new audience, Now, in My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (title courtesy of the Ramones song), we are treated to the full range of Heatley's remarkable, wildly unique voice and vision.
My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down is Heatley's life story told in six different but connected narrative threads. ""Sex History"" describes every sexual encounter dating back to kindergarten, with details that would make a therapist blush. ""Black History"" is an unflinchingly honest meditation on his own racism. ""Portrait of My Mom"" and ""Portrait of My Dad"" are beautifully paced vignettes, skewering and celebrating his lovably dysfunctional parents. ""Family History"" tells the story of his family from his great-great-grandparents' lives and closes with the birth of his own children.

""The Toronto cartoonist's first full-length graphic novel follows a clutch of misfit ants, trying to maintain some semblance of civilization in the shadow of war. Psychedelically gorgeous, uncomfortably funny."" --Sean Rogers, Globe & MailBest Books of 2014
The debut graphic novel from a dazzling newcomer with a singular, idiosyncratic style
Big Kidsis simultaneously Michael DeForge's most straightforward narrative and his most complex work to date. It follows a troubled teenage boy through the transformative years of high school as he redefines his friends, his interests, and his life path. When the boy's uncle, a police officer, gets kicked out of the family's basement apartment and transferred to the countryside, April moves in. She's a college student, mysterious and cool, and she quickly takes a shine to the boy.
The boy's own interests quickly fade away: he stops engaging in casual sex, taking drugs, and testing the limits of socially acceptable (and legal) behavior. Instead, he hangs out with April and her friends, a bunch of highly evolved big kids who spend their days at the campus swimming pool. And slowly, the boy begins to change, too.
Eerie and perfectly paced, DeForge's Big Kids muses on the complicated, and often contradictory, feelings people struggle with during adolescence, the choices we make to fit in, and the ways we survive times of change. Like Ant Colony and First Year Healthy, Big Kidsis a testimony to the harshness and beauty of being alive.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25666072-big-kids

Hotwire Comixwill not be reviewed in The New Yorkeror the New York Times. Hotwire Comixis a full-throttle, kick-ass jolt to the nervous system, a return to the glory days of underground/alternative comics before we all started to drown in 200-page graphic novels in which the most exciting part is the moment when the perpetually depressed protagonist gets up, walks across the room, and makes himself a cup of tea.
Edited by New York cartoonist Glenn Head (who put together the classic 1990s trilogy of Snake Eyesanthologies), Hotwire Comixis a big, bold, beautiful poke to the old eyeballs featuring short, punchy, hilarious, all-around comics 'n' stories. Head himself, whose work looks like a demented cross between the Roberts Williams and Crumb, starts the dance with the epic ""Switchblade Shenanigans!,"" in which nitrous oxide-addicted balloonheads indulge in dangerous knifeplay while they bungle a kidnapping.
Elsewhere, David Lasky relates ""The Last Days of Joe Strummer""; Tony (Maakies) Millionaire contributes a ""Little Nemo in Wonderland""-style dream story; plus new strips by Max (Death and Candy) Andersson, Tim Lane, Matt Madden, Mats!?, Brad Johnson, Danny Hellman, Angry Youth Comix'Johnny ""Rolling StoneCool Cartoonist of the Year"" Ryan, Mack White, Judith McNicol, and a six-page fold-out by Craig (Modern Arf) Yoe.

sick,The Furry Trap,Josh Simmons,anxiety,"Graphic novelist Josh Simmons (House) returns with a harrowing and genre-bending collection of modern horror short stories that could curl the toes of a corpse in a state of rigor mortis. Simmons disturbing, uncomfortable and even confrontational stories often work on multiple levels: straight, uncompromising horror; blackly humorous, satirical riffs on the genre; or as vicious assaults against the political correctness that rules so much of our popular culture. His artwork excels in conveying a feeling of dread and claustrophobia, and the stories herein all share an unmistakably and uncompromising commitment to exploring the crossroads of abomination and hilarity.
The Furry Trap contains 11 short stories, varying in length from one to 30 pages, as well as a number of extras that will flesh out the reader s experience. From the title creatures in Night of the Jibblers, to the witches and ogres of Cockbone, to the Godzilla-sized, centaur-bodied depiction of the title character in Jesus Christ, to the disarmingly cute yet terrifying demons of Demonwood, to the depraved, caped crusading antihero in Mark of the Bat, Simmons is a master of creating terrifying beasties that inspire and inflict nightmarish horrors, usually taken to unforgettable extremes.
The individual stories in The Furry Trap stand on their own as mini-masterpieces of skin-crawling terror, but collectively complement each other in a way that only heightens the anxiety and dread pouring from page to page.

Unlike those works, Ripple is a highly realistic story in terms of subject matter and drawing style. Martin is a floundering painter desperately attempting to pursue his fine art inclinations rather than toil in the world of commercial art. He hires a homely model, Tina, to pose for a series of ""erotic"" paintings that he hopes will be his breakthrough into the gallery world. Over time, Martin and Tina's relationship evolves from a tenuous working relationship to a confused sexual one. Martin's initial repulsion for Tina slowly turns to attraction and eventually lust, causing him to re-evaluate his own notions of beauty and sexuality. Meanwhile, Tina's own motives behind working for Martin are slowly turned upside down as well, building the book towards its inevitably explosive end. Throughout it all, Ripple is a complex love story poked and prodded from all angles, from Martin and Tina's physical and emotional feelings toward each other, Martin's dishonesty to himself, Tina's self-loathing, and everything in between. Sad, funny, and often uncomfortably titillating, Ripple is a remarkably introspective graphic novel, rendered with kinetic realism in a pen technique that calls to mind a more controlled Edward Sorel and Jules Feiffer.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/715684.Ripple

sick,"Jessica Farm, Vol. 1",Josh Simmons,,"The creator of ""House"" embarks on a life-spanning epic.
Hot on the heels of his first graphic novel, ""House,"" Josh Simmons' ""Jessica Farm"" fuses serialized adventure, fantasy and psychological horror and stamps it with his signature macabre sensibility in this atmospheric new graphic novel. Like a Lynchian take on ""Alice in Wonderland, Jessica Farm"" opens with an exterior of what could be any Midwestern farmhouse. Once inside, we track our titular heroine as she bounds out of bed on Christmas and goes about her morning routine, eventually breakfasting with her grandparents. The banality of the situation is subverted by a ratcheting sense of dread, however, as we discover that Jessica's increasingly nightmarish house is filled with creatures around every corner: some whimsical, some sexual, some despairing and some malevolent. Most terrifying of all is Jessica's father, whose promise of presents under the tree is loaded with the threat of violence.

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.

cancer,Special Exits,Joyce Farmer,health,"Joyce Farmer's memoir chronicles the decline of the author's parents' health, their relationship with one another and with their daughter, and how they cope with the day-to-day emotional fragility of the most taxing time of their lives.
Elderly parents Lars and Rachel, who have enjoyed a long and loving married life together, are rendered in fine, confident pen lines. Set in southern Los Angeles (which makes for a terrifying sequence as blind Rachel and ailing Lars are trapped in their home without power during the 1992 Rodney King riots), backgrounds and props are lovingly detailed: these objects serve as memory triggers for Lars and Rachel, even as they eventually overwhelm them and their home, which the couple is loathe to leave. Special Exitsis laid out in an eight-panel grid, which creates a leisurely storytelling pace that not only helps to convey the slow, inexorable decline in Lars' and Rachel's health, but perfectly captures the timbre of the exchanges between a long-married couple: the affectionate bickering; their gallows humor; their querulousness as their bodies break down.
Though Lars and Rachel are the protagonists of Special Exits, Farmer makes her voice known through creative visual metaphors and in her indictment of the careless treatment of the elderly in nursing homes. Special Exitsgracefully deals with the hard reality of caring for aging loved ones: those who are or who have been in similar situations might find comfort in it, and those who haven't will find much to admire in the bravery and good humor of Lars and Rachel. Joyce Farmer, best known for co-creating the Tits 'n Clitscomics anthology in the 1970s, a feminist response to the rampant misogyny in underground comix, spent 11 years crafting Special Exits, a graphic memoir in the vein of Alison Bechdel's Fun Homeor Harvey Pekar, Joyce Brabner, and Frank Stack's Our Cancer Year, about caring for her dying father and stepmother.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8400446-special-exits

A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statemen.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6407014-stitches

Next came his only series, in which this hard-smoking, hard-drinking, all around manipulator walked the thin line of magic between this world and hell. So when Irishman Garth Ennis was asked to write this comic book, he had asked himself, ""What could I possibly do to John Constantine that hadn't been done before? And one course of action suddenly stood out above all others: Kill him."" The result is a tense supernatural drama that begins with Constantine being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Though this book only hints at the freeform casualness and over-the-top vulgarity that became Ennis's trademark in the Preacher series, this is an immensely enjoyable read with strong characters and dynamite plot twists. --Jim Pascoe

cancer,Stitches: A Memoir,David Small,cancer,"Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award and finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards: the prize-winning children's author depicts a childhood from hell in this searing yet redemptive graphic memoir.
One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die.
In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David--a highly anxious yet supremely talented child--all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage.
Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician, who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden.
Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen--with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist--will resonate as the ultimate survival statement.
A silent movie masquerading as a book, Stitches renders a broken world suddenly seamless and beautiful again. Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award (Young Adult); finalist for two 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards (Best Writer/Artist: Nonfiction; Best Reality-Based Work).",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13509102-stitches

cancer,Paul en Quebec,Michel Rabagliati,,"Paul en Quebec, quinto volumen publicado en castellano de la serie de Rabagliati, reflexiona sobre la muerte, el duelo y la independencia de Quebec
Tras abordar el tema de la paternidad en Paul va de pesca (Astiberri, 2012), Michel Rabagliati se enfrenta en Paul en Quebec con el de la muerte y el duelo. Roland y Lisette, los suegros de Paul, se mudan a Quebec para disfrutar de su jubilacion, pero poco tiempo despues, Roland enferma. Este quinto volumen publicado en castellano de la serie de Paul se convierte en la cronica de la perdida de un ser querido. Una historia personal y conmovedora, en la que se perciben los fuertes vinculos que unen a la familia y que permitiran superar ese duro momento.
Paul en Quebec tambien incluye reflexiones sobre cuestiones politicas como la independencia de Quebec y la desilusion colectiva que supuso el referendum de 1995. Tambien hace referencia a la llegada de las nuevas tecnologias en la vida de Paul, y a todas las incertidumbres que conllevaba el paso al segundo milenio...
Michel Rabagliati apunta, respecto a este quinto volumen, que ""se trata de un homenaje a mi suegro. Era un hombre del monton que se hizo a si mismo (...). Todas las historias que cuento las he vivido yo. No soy capaz de hacer ficcion.

cancer,The Fountain,Darren Aronofsky Kent Williams,cancer,"Darren Aronofsky proved himself a filmmaker to watch with his provocative debut, Pi. His follow-up, Requiem for a Dream, continued the accolades, receiving Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. His latest accomplishment, however, comes straight to comics in the form of THE FOUNTAIN, a gorgeously painted, oversized original graphic novel about the timeless truths of life, love and death.
Working with acclaimed painter Kent Williams (BLOOD: A TALE, DESTINY: A CHRONICLE OF DEATHS FORETOLD), THE FOUNTAIN crisscrosses through three distinct time periods: 1535, during an ancient Mayan war; the present day, following one doctor's desperate search for the cure for cancer; and the far future through the vast exotic reaches of space. Interweaving these three periods, THE FOUNTAIN follows Tomas -- warrior, doctor, explorer -- as he feverishly tries to beat death and prolong the life of the woman he loves.
A story so grand, one medium couldn't contain it, Aronofsky's feature film version of THE FOUNTAIN will be released by Warner Bros. Pictures and Regency Enterprises, starring Tony-award winning actor Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Van Helsing, The Boy from Oz) and acclaimed actress Rachel Weisz (Constantine, The Mummy, the upcoming The Constant Gardener). But before he did, the filmmaker wanted THE FOUNTAIN to be realized in the unique storytelling power and artistic beauty of the graphic novel.

A story from the comic strips that will make you laugh and cry
Tom Batiuk spent several years as a middle school art teacher before creating the comic strip Funky Winkerbeanin 1972. Originally a ""gag-a-day"" comic strip that portrayed life in high school, Funkyhas evolved into a mature series of real-life stories examining such social issues as teen dating abuse, teen pregnancy, teen suicide, violence in schools, the war in the Middle East, alcoholism, divorce, and cancer.
In 1999, Lisa Moore, one of Funky's friends and a main character, discovered she had breast cancer. Batiuk, unsure about dealing with such a serious subject on the funny pages, decided to go ahead with the story line. He approached the topic with the idea that mixing humor with serious and real themes heightens the reader's interest. Lisa and husband Les faced the same physical, psychological, and social issues as anyone else dealing with the disease.
After a mastectomy and chemotherapy, Lisa was cancer free. She finished her law degree, opened a practice, and had a baby daughter, Summer. Then, in the spring of 2006, the cancer returned and metastasized. Lisa's Story: The Other Shoeis a collection of both the 1999 comic strips on Lisa's initial battle with cancer and the current series examining her struggle with the disease and its outcome. Additionally, it contains resource material on breast cancer, including early detection, information sources, support systems, and health care.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1721886.Lisa_s_Story

With this stunning graphic memoir, David Small takes readers on an unforgettable journey into the dark heart of his tumultuous childhood in 1950s Detroit, in a coming-of-age tale like no other.
At the age of fourteen, David awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover his throat had been slashed and one of his vocal chords removed, leaving him a virtual mute. No one had told him that he had cancer and was expected to die. The resulting silence was in keeping with the atmosphere of secrecy and repressed frustration that pervaded the Small household and revealed itself in the slamming of cupboard doors, the thumping of a punching bag, the beating of a drum.
Believing that they were doing their best, David's parents did just the reverse. David's mother held the family emotionally hostage with her furious withdrawals, even as she kept her emotions hidden -- including from herself. His father, rarely present, was a radiologist, and although David grew up looking at X-rays and drawing on X-ray paper, it would be years before he discovered the shocking consequences of his father's faith in science.

That/s the question that sets this powerful, funny, and poignant graphic memoir in motion. In vivid color and with a taboo-breaking sense of humor, Marisa Acocella Marchetto tells the story of her eleven-month, ultimately triumphant bout with breast cancer--from diagnosis to cure, and every challenging step in between.
But Cancer Vixenis about more than surviving an illness. It is a portrait of one woman's supercharged life in Manhattan, and a wonderful love story. Marisa, self-described ""terminal bachelorette"", meets her Prince Charming in Silvano, owner of the chic downtown restaurant Da Silvano. Three weeks before their wedding, she receives her diagnosis. She wonders: How will he react to this news? How will my world change? Will I even survive? And... what about my hair?
From raucous New Yorkerstaff lunches and the star-studded crowd at Silvano/s restaurant to the rainbow pumps Marisa wears to chemotherapy, Cancer Vixenis a total original.

An odyssey about one man's thousand-year struggle to save the woman he loves, The Fountainfollows Thomas as he feverishly travels through three distinct eras: as a 16th century conquistador battling a fierce Mayan army, as a present-day scientist searching for a cure for his wife's mortal disease and as a future explorer seeking to uncover the secrets of a dying star.
An epic love story so grand that one medium cannot contain it, Aronofsky's feature film - released by Warner Bros, Pictures and Regency Enterprises - stars Tony Award-winner Hugh Jackman (The Boy from Oz, X-Men) and Oscar-winner Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener, The Mummy).
The Fountaingraphic novel is a sister-project to the film, using the same story as its seed, but stretched instead upon the limitless canvas of the comics medium.

cancer,Special Exits,Joyce Farmer Ledvinska F. R.,health,"Joyce Farmer's memoir chronicles the decline of the author's parents' health, their relationship with one another and with their their daughter, and how they cope with the day-to-day emotional fragility of the most taxing time of their lives.
Elderly parents Lara and Rachel, who have enjoyed a long and loving married life together, are rendered in fine, confident pen lines. Set in southern Los Angeles (which makes for a terrifying sequence as blind Rachel and ailing Lars are trapped in their home without power during the 1992 Rodney King riots), backgrounds and props are lovingly detailed: these objects serve as memory triggers for Lars and Rachel, even as they eventually overwhelm them and their home, which the couple is loathe to leave. Special Exitsis laid out in an eight-panel grid, which creates a leisurely storytelling pace that not only helps to convey the slow, inexorable decline in Lars'
and Rachel's health, but perfectly captures the timbre of the exchanges between a long-married couple: the affectionate bickering; their gallows humor; their querulousness as their bodies break down.
Though Lars and Rachel are the protagonists of Special Exits, Farmer makes her voice known through creative visual metaphors and in her indictment of the careless treatment of the elderly in nursing homes. Special Exits gracefully deals with the hard reality of caring for aging loved ones: those who are or who have been in similar situations might find comfort in it, and those who haven't will find much to admire in the bravery and good humor of Lars and Rachel.
Joyce Farmer, best known for co-creating the Tits 'n Clitscomics anthology in the 1970s, a feminist response to the rampant misogyny in underground comix, spent 11 years crafting Special Exits, a graphic memoir in the vein of Alison Bechdel's Fun Homeor Harvey Pekar, Joyce Brabner, and Frank Stack's Our Cancer Year, about caring for her dying father and stepmother.
Lars e Rachel sono due coniugi che affrontano la parte finale della propria vita - la vecchiaia, la malattia, la morte - accuditi con premurosa attenzione dalla figlia. Joyce Farmer racconta semplicemente cio che ha vissuto prendendosi cura dei suoi genitori, concentrandosi sui dettagli della routine quotidiana, nello scorrere dei giorni e degli anni, creando un commovente ritratto di famiglia, dove non mancano momenti difficili, drammatici, ma neanche l'ironia dell'intimita. In questo memoir grafico, realistico e senza sentimentalismi, creato in 10 anni di lavoro, l'autrice mostra la fragilita del periodo piu difficile della vita, senza mai tirarsi indietro davanti agli imbarazzanti oltraggi della vecchiaia, con il lento decadere dei corpi e la mente che si confonde facilmente, non dimenticando il contesto di questa narrazione domestica fatta di frustrazioni e tenerezze: il presente nel South Los Angeles anni '80 e '90 e gli States della prima meta del '900 ricordati dai suoi genitori.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35535098-special-exits

cancer,The Story of My Tits,Jennifer Hayden,cancer,"A landmark work of graphic memoir and a cancer narrative that pulls no punches.
When Jennifer Hayden was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 43, she realized that her tits told a story. Across a lifetime, they'd held so many meanings: hope and fear, pride and embarrassment, life and death. And then they were gone. Now, their story has become a way of understanding her story. Growing up flat-chested and highly aware of her inadequacies... heading off to college, where she ""bloomed"" in more ways than one... navigating adulthood between her mother's mastectomy, her father's mistress, and her musician boyfriend's problems of his own--not to mention his sprawling family. Then the kids come along... As cancer strikes three different lives, some relationships crumble while others emerge even stronger, and this sarcastic child of the '70s finally finds a goddess she can believe in.
For everyone who's faced cancer personally, or watched a loved one fight that battle, Hayden's story is a much-needed breath of fresh air, an irresistible blend of sweetness and skepticism. Rich with both symbolism & humor, The Story of My Tits will leave you laughing, weeping, and feeling grateful for every day.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25652567-the-story-of-my-tits

And of course, there is Boganch, Kalman's in-laws' ""big black slobbering Hungarian Beast."" And that's just the beginning.

But when her anxiety finally became overwhelming, she knew it was time to see a therapist.
To her surprise, Terian learned endless coping techniques through her therapy sessions.

With this strong entry in the autobiographical comic genre, Roberts is unafraid to show herself looking bad, such as when she's frustrated when her daughter, Xia, calls her-only to find out it's to say ""I love you."" In the comic's best pages, Roberts and Xia struggle with toilet training (""That already happened,"" Xia beams when she is warned to keep her butt out of the bowl), and Xia abuses her swearing privileges. The linework on the characters is detailed while retaining a sketchiness for backgrounds that makes the figures feel raw, rather than polished. The simple, direct art makes for an intimate, personal journey through Roberts's life as a mother and creator."" Alex Hoffman, Sequential State, 5 June, 2015 - ""Roberts' comics primarily explore her relationship with her daughter Xia and husband Scott, as well as her interactions with friends and extended family. These are classic slice-of-life comics, and Roberts uses sometimes panels, sometimes full pages to capture the essence of certain moments. Xia is growing up and learning about the world around her, and the strange internal logic of toddlers gives Miseryland much of its charm. Slice-of-life comics can often be cute or endearing, but Miseryland is funny, laugh out loud funny, mostly due to the inanities and bad behaviors of its youngest cast member and Roberts' deadpan reactions. Importantly, Roberts isn't writing a ""kids say the darndest things"" comic; as panels and pages fall into place throughout Miseryland, these small stories paint a picture of Roberts as a melancholy, anxious mother living with bipolar disorder and trying to find the best way to raise her daughter. Xia is oftentimes the access point to these feelings, pointing out the hidden in ways that make it seem obvious. Miseryland isn't a tell all, either - even when things like Roberts miscarriage come up, the stories told are more a remembering than an exposure. We find Roberts at high and low points throughout the book, and while these moments coalesce into a larger vision, Miseryland has time to explore the way creative processes and personal time are changed after you have children. Some of these comics are certainly a part of the book because Xia wasn't napping when Roberts was drawing, just as some are there to illustrate Roberts fears and frustrations."" printed with the assistance of Koyama Press",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25304516-miseryland

Julie Delporte's Everywhere Antennas is a deeply affecting, sparely constructed novel, equal parts Waldenand The Bell Jar. Told in the first person, it offers diary-like entries from an anonymous narrator who is undergoing a nervous breakdown and struggling to hold together a failing relationship. In soft, flowing colored pencil, Delporte shows her narrator coming to terms with a rare and misunderstood sensitivity to the radiation emitted by the televisions, cell phones, and computers that permeate urban life.
On each page a few words are paired with an image or two, conveying a moment or a thought simply but effectively. Over the course of the book, the anonymous narrator moves from place to place, looking for solutions to her melancholy in the countryside via isolation and in the city with friends, sometimes turning to medication for answers. Throughout, her emotional and intellectual landscape receives as much attention as her physical surroundings.
Everywhere Antennasis the portrait of a woman caught in the margins, struggling to balance the demands of technology and modern life with the need to find meaningful relationships and work. Roughly hewn figures, sketched in pencil crayon on brightly contrasting backgrounds, populate the pages of this flowing, emotive work.
